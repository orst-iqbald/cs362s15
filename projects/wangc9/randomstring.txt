How to compile: gcc -Wall -std=c99 -o testme testme.c

inputChar(): The ASCII of the nine characters range from 32 to 125, so I implemented the inputChar() function by just selecting a random number within the range from 32 to 125.

inputString(): It would not be reasonable to randomize all words of five characters, because that would result in more than 10 million iterations. Instead, I selected each of the characters from the pool of 'r', 'e', 's', and 't', in order to generate a random string within a reasonable amount of time.  

The program will run about 1000 iterations to reach the 'error' message.
