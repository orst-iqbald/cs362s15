randomtestcard.c: Testing Steward Card
File 'dominion.c'
Lines executed:26.43% of 575
Branches executed:22.28% of 413
Taken at least once:19.13% of 413
Calls executed:16.13% of 93

Within the newSteward() function we have 93.90% statement coverage and 84.62% branch coverage.

returned 100% blocks executed 86%. This was far better than cardtest4, where 0 blocks were called because of a bug
in the beginning of the newSteward() function. In randomtestcard, this was not an issue for block coverage.


Coverage was about the same for the random test of the Steward card as I had in cardtest4 for the Steward card.
However, this randomtest did have slightly better statement and branch coverage, and more calls executed - 16.13%
in randomtestcard.c as opposed to 12.90% in cardtest4.c

randomtestadventurer.c: 
File 'dominion.c'
Lines executed:29.57% of 575
Branches executed:24.21% of 413
Taken at least once:21.31% of 413
Calls executed:18.28% of 93

returned 100% blocks executed 98%
Within the newAdventurer() function we have 100% branch and statement coverage. 

Compared to my cardtest, I got slightly more statement coverage, branches coverage was slightly higher,
and I got higher calls executed as well, 18.28% in randomtestadventurer.c as opposed to 10.75% in cardtest2.c.
My randomtest had better coverage than cardtest2.
