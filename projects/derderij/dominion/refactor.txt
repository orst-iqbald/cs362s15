Cards update: 
	Adventurer
	Cutpurse
	Smithy
	Steward
	Village

Bug introduced:
	Adventurer: Made the while loop continue until it’s greater than 2, used <=. 
				Also the discard pile will be reshuffled when there is 1 or less card left in the deck instead of just 0.
		
	Cutpurse: Gives player 3 coins instead of 2. The Copper that is normally discarded is trashed instead.

	Smithy: A fourth card is drawn, as the loop was changed to i <= 3. 
			And the Smithy card is trashed upon use instead of discarded.

	Steward: Instead of the 2 cards being trashed, they are instead discarded, and the Steward card is trashed upon use.

	Village: The player loses 2 actions instead of gaining 2 actions.
