Bug #0:
My unit test 4 can find out a bug in the function scoreFor() in dominion.c, because "unittestresults.out" shows some values that are NOT expected. I then further investigated the code in detail, and noticed that the function scoreFor() has a bug in the third loop.  The range should be from 0 to deckCount instead of discardCount.
