- Description: A report of bug fixes performed in teammates & my dominion code.
*******************************************************************************/

Fixed bug 1 in Ryan Peterson's code, by correctly calling smithy card with the
   currentPlayer,  on line 935 of dominion.c, instead of with the nextPlayer. 
   This resolved two of the issues from the bug 2 report. 

Fixed bug discovered while debugging bug 2: The card following smithy is
   discarded(added to playedCards), instead of smithy. The Smithy card is now 
   correctly added. Bug remainder of bug 2 as described below still exists, not 
   sure of correct fix:

   The discard count was still not increased by 1, indicating additional bugs. 
   Test 3: discardCount count not increased by 1, Expected: 5. Returned: 4.
   I ran GDB, and discovered that after drawing three cards, state-hand[0][1] 
   held an extra card, which was not accounted for by state->handCount[0]. Also,
   the discardCard() function was called with handPos of 1, instead of 0, the
   current position of the Smithy card. (This can be fixed by changing hanPos+1 
   to simply handPos in the function call to discardCard()).  At the end of 
   stepping through the smithyEffect function, I realized that the discardCard() 
   function places discarded cards in the playedCards collection, And I'm not 
   certain if the discard[player] collection should be updated by the 
   discardCard() function, or the endTurn() function. Do all played/discarded 
   cards during a turn go into the playedCards collection until the end of the 
   turn, and if not, at what point do they get placed into the discard pile. One 
   thing is clear, and that is that the discard pile is not being updated.

Fixed bug 3 in Ryan Peterson's code.
   While debugging, I discovered and fixed a few bugs in my test code that 
   displayed the incorrect expected value of other player's hand count. I had 
   also incorrectly assumed that when a hand shrunk, it would be overwritten 
   with a -1, but that was not the case, so I adjusted my test to compare hand 
   size rather than card value for some tests.
   
   I discovered that when no coins were found in either the deck or discard pile
   when the adventurer card was played, the hand size would change though it
   should have remained unchanged.
   
   The issue I discovered was that the shuffle function only shuffled the deck, 
   so I had to move the discard to the deck, and once I did that, all tests
   passed.
   
Fixed Bug 1 in Kristin Swanson's code, in which all but one non-treasure cards,
   drawn during play of the adventurer card, were placed in the discard pile. 
   The issue was a simple logic error in the final while loop of the 
   play_adventurer() function. I changed while(z-1>0) to while(z>0).
   
Fixed Bug 2 in Kristin Swanson's code in which the discard flag was set to 1, 
   causing smithy card to be trashed rather than discarded. I set it to 0.
   
Debugging my own code:
