CS362 – Assignment 2 refactor.txt

#3
5 cards selected were:
Adventurer Card
       Subtle bug: defined cardDrawn within function, but also left an unused defined cardDrawn variable within the cardEffect function.
Council Room Card
	Subtle bug: Incorrectly adds an additional buy for the player, where it is only supposed to add a single extra buy.
Feast Card
	Subtle bug: defined x within function, but also left an unused defined x variable within the cardEffect function
Smithy Card
	Subtle bug: the for loop will provide 4 cards (instead of the intended 3 cards). This goes against the mechanics of the Dominion game.
Remodel Card
