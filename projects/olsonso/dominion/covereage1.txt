I feel pretty confidenent in this one since 100 percent of the branches were covered.

Again happy with 100 percent of branched covered but not every line was covered. I had to go back and look deeper into my testing to see what was going on. 

File 'unittest3.c'
Lines executed:82.61% of 23
Branches executed:100.00% of 8
Taken at least once:50.00% of 8
No calls
unittest3.c:creating 'unittest3.c.gcov'

This one I found needed some help since clearly some of the branches were not getting touched at all. 

File 'unittest4.c'
Lines executed:78.82% of 22
Branches executed:60.00% of 7
Taken at least once:50.00% of 7
No calls
unittest4.c:creating 'unittest4.c.gcov'

This was my least confidence testing file so far. This was a clear indicator that i had a lot of work that needed to make sure that every branch was getting hit, especially more than 50 percent.
