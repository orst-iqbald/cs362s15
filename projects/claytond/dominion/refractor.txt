			Bug introduced to the following cards:
Adventurer, Smithy, Great_Hall, Embargo and Outpost.

Adventurer: 
Changed condition to shuffle the deck to be <=1. The deck will be shuffled and added to when one card is present.

Smithy: 
Set for loop parameters to dispense 4 cards by setting stop condition to <= 3. 

Great_Hall:
Amount of actions are decremented by 1 rather than incrementing. Flag passed to discardCard() to trash card instead of discarding by changing 0 to 1.

Embargo:
Increments value of coins by 1 rather than 2. Returns 0 instead of -1 if selected pile is in play. Flag passed to discardCard() to discard card instead of trashing by changing 1 to 0.

Outpost: 
Flag passed to discardCard() to trash card instead of discarding by changing 0 to 1.
