Smithy
======
The smithy card calls the draw card method three times on the current player
while passing in the current state of the game. Once all three new cards have
been drawn the smithy card is then discarded from the current players hand
using the discardCard() method.

Adventurer
==========
The adventurer cards loop through the players deck until it has drawn three
treasurer cards. The other cards it draws are put into a tempHand array which is
discarded after the three treasurer cards are found.

discardCard()
=============
The discardCard method takes in the handPos of the card to be discarded, the
currentPlayer, the gameState, and a trash flag if the card at the handPos is to
be trashed instead of discarded.

First the method checks to see if the trash flag is set and then trashes the
card and adds it to the played pile. It then sets the position of where the
discarded/trash card to -1, which I am assuming mean 

First the method checks to see if the trash flag is set and trashes the card, it
then sets the current position of that card to -1, which I am assuming to mean
there is no card there. It then removes the card from the players hand and
reduces the card count, however it make sures that its not removing the last
hand or that its not removing the 2nd to last card. It then replaces the
discarded card with the last card in the hand.  

updateCoins()
=============
The update coin method takes in the current player, the gameState and a bounus
int, which I am guessing is the number of coins to be added to the player.

First the method sets the coins in the state struct to zero. It then loops
through that players hand counts up all the treasures in the hand, and then adds
the bonus, which must be the bonus from cards that give a +gold bonus. The
function then returns.
