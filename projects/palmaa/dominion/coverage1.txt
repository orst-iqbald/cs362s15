Coverage information on source code enabled for profiling with gcov is accumulated
in the <source>.gcda file.  That means that after running one of our tests, some
information of what's been covered is recorded in the .gcda file.  If we run another
test, then additional information is added to the .gcda file.  Etc....

If you run gcov <source>    then you get overall summary information of lines covered
If you run gcov -b <source> then you get overall summary info on %branches covered
If you run gcov -f <source> then you get info on lines covered in each identifiable function.
You can also combine the flags (like gcov -b -f <source>) to get branch and line coverage
per identifiable function.
