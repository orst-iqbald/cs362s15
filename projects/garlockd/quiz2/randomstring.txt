Quiz 2

To start I followed the code to see what information needed to be added. First i noticed that it needed a character out of the following [, (, }, ' ', a, x, }, ), ]
There are nine of these so i had it choose one at random and return it.

I also noticed that it needed a string but the only characters it needed were r, e , s, e ,t, \0

i put these characters into an array and had it choose the order at random and then return it.

The testme.c appears to run until its at state 9 along with the string "reset" at this point you reach the error and it stops running.

I ran this several times with a minimum of 7488 iterations and a maximum of 42598 iterations before finding the error sequence.
