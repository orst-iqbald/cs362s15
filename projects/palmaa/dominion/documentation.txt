- description/understanding of smithy card code (in case smithy):
----------------------------------------------
  execute drawCard(currrentPlayer, state) in a for loop 3 times
  to add/draw 3 cards to your hand from deck

  execute discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0)
  to discard the smithy (current) card from player's hand


-------------
- description/understanding of adventurer card code(in case adventurer):
----------------------------------------------
  until 2 treasure cards drawn from deck and placed in hand
    if deck empty
      reshuffle discards and add them to deck 
          ****NOTE:  seems like subtle bug here with code when deck is empty.
          ****       it calls shuffle() directly, with an empty deck and
          ****       shuffle function first check is if deck empty, where it will fail
          ****       the calling of drawCard function will take discards
          ****       add them to empty deck and then call shuffle
    draw a card 
    if drawn card is treasure card
      add treasure card to hand
    else
      add drawn card to a temp deck/hand (not discard, yet)

  after exit above loop, discard all cards in the temp deck/hand

  (keeping the adventurer card in hand)


-------------
- description/understanding of discardCard():
-----------------------------------------------
 if card is not to be trashed
   then place/add card to played/discard pile

 set value of played card in hand[index] to -1

 if played card was last card of player hand or the only card in player hand
   then reduce player's hand count (of cards) by 1
   else  switch values of hand[index] with that of the last card in player hand (array)

 reduce player's hand count by 1


-------------
- description/understanding of updateCoins():

 finally add whatever bonus value to get the total value
