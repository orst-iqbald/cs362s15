1. Adventurer was implemented as it's own function and removed from the
switch statement in cardEffect.

2. Smithy was implemented as it's own function and removed from the switch 
statement in cardEffect.

3. Council Room, Village and Great Hall were implemented as their own 
functions and removed from the switch statement in cardEffect.

4. Introduction of bugs: 

playAdventurerCard() - the if-statement controlling when drawntreasure gets
incremented has had the conditionals checking for copper and silver removed.
Now, if a player uses an Adventurer card, they will continue drawing until
2 gold treasures are drawn.

playSmithyCard() - when the card is discarded, the trash flag is set, so
that the player loses this card permanently.

playCouncil_RoomCard() - the for-loop controlling each other player
drawing a card now has an or-condition that makes the currentPlayer 
draw a card as well.

playGreat_HallCard() - rather than incrementing state->numactions, it is
decremented, effectively ending the players Action phase unless they had
previously played a card with +2 Actions.
