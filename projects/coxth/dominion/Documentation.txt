The smith card itself, if chosen runs a for loop.  The loop runs 3 times and the loop execution has a statement that calls
drawCard function where the currentPlayer obtains 3 cards and the state of the currentPlayers gameState is updated.
 
The adventurer uses a while loop to cycle through the currentPlayer hand until 2 treasure cards are drawn.   If the deckCount
is 0 the cards are reshuffled, the cardDrawn is the top card and if the cardDrawn is copper, silver, or gold the drawn treasure 
count is incremented.  If the card is not a treasure that card is removed as it is the most current top card and it is put into 
a temphand array while the treasure cards are sought ought.  The temphand array is then discarded after 2 treasure cards are drawn.

The discardCard() function takes 4 arguments, the location of the card in the hand to be discarded, the player who’s hand the card is
in, the gameState struct  and the flag indicating if the card is to be trashed.  If the trashFlag is set to 0 the card is discarded.  
This is where the playedCards array in the state struct is set equal to the hand position of the current player’s card that is played.
The played card is set to -1 and that card is removed from the player’s hand and the total number of cards in the player’s hand is decremented.
  
The updateCoins() function loops through all the cards in the players hand.  For each copper card the player possesses the player gets +1,
for each silver carder the player possesses the player gets +2 coins, for each gold card the player possesses the player gets +3 coins.  
Nothing is added for other cards.  After the hand is looped through the bonus coins the player has acquired gets added to the coin total.
