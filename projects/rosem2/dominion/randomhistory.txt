Assignment 4
Random test development


randomtestadventurer.c
	This random tester improved over my last card test and caught indirectly caught the bug that
	I had implemented. It was showing that the hands never had the correct amount of cards, they
	were always short 1 card. Sometimes I was getting negative values for my discard piles. On 
	certain runs the deck was also smaller than expected. Whenever the code caught my bug,
	the discard pile would show that the cards in the pile were not the same. The deck never varied
	in order even when it varied in size, but the hand would aos vary.When the hand varied, it was 
	always the 2nd and sometimes last card that were different. I got 100% code coverage.
	In 500 runs, it covered every line of newAdventurer at least 500 times except for the shuffle
	line, which it only covered 88 times.

randomtestcard.c
	This random tester was also an improvement over the previous test. The deck was always 2 cards
	larger than expected and the hand was always 3 cards smaller. I had not noticed 2 bugs that this
	test pointed out to me in newSmithy. The second card in the players hand is always overwritten
	and the counter(i) is always incremented twice. On certain occausions, the deck and discard were
	also off, I am not sure why.
	Once again, the code coverage was good 100%. each line was covered either 502 or 1004 times on 500
	runs.
