Random Testing Quiz

My random tester finds the error message by randomizing the char and string input.
For inputChar() I allocated a char arry of the characters the program is searching for in the main if statement:
[, (, }, ' ', a, x, }, ), ]
The size of this array is 9 so I chose a random number from 1 to 9 and returned the character in the random spot in the array.

For inputString I did something similar.
I allocated another array of the characters the program looks for: {'r', 'e', 's', 't', '\0'}
Because the main if statement is checking for 2 e's I use a for statement that iterates 6 times: r, e, s, e, t, \0
A new array is initialized with a size of 6.  5 places for the letters and 1 space for the null character, terminating the string.
In the for loop I select a random spot in the char array so it chooses one of r, e, s, t, or \0.
Example: myString[rand()%5]
I fill in the new array randomly using the iteration, picking a random character for each place.

In this way a random character from certain selection is chosen and a random string from a choice of characters
is made and passed into the main if statement- a "guided random test."
