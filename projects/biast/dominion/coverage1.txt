A fairly thorough test of discardCard. I was able to detect the errors in it. It appears that the only
line I failed to execute was the one triggered by the conditional checking to see if you have only one
card in your hand. I do put the function through this circumstance, but it triggered the preceding
conditional as well, and so it bypassed this else if check.

I fully put this function through its paces I think.
