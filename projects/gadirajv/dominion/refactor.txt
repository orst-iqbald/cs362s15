In dominion.c I changed the code so the following cards – Smithy, Adventurer, Council Room, Village, and Steward – were implemented in their own functions, rather than as part of the switch statement in cardEffect. The function declarations are listed below. 
int newSmithy(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int handPos);
int newAdventurer(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state);
int newCouncil_Room(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int handPos);
int newVillage (int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int handPos);
int newSteward(int choice1, int choice2, int choice3, int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int handPos);
I introduced bugs in the code for the Smithy, Adventurer, Council Room, and Steward cards.
newSmithy()
The smithy card allows the player to draw three cards by calling drawCard() three times. Then the card from the hand is discarded by calling discardCard().
I introduced a bug where the discardCard() function is called from inside the for loop that calls drawCard three times so the discardCard() function is called three times.
newAdventurer()
The adventurer card allows a player to reveal cards from their deck until they reveal 2 Treasure cards. This is implemented by calling the drawCard() function inside of a while condition that runs unless 2 or more treasure cards are revealed. If the deck runs out (is empty), then the discard pile is shuffled and added to the deck.
I changed the while condition from (drawntreasure < 2) to (drawntreasure <= 2), which will result in an extra loop through the while loop, since if there are 2 treasure cards, the loop will run again. 
newCouncil_Room()
The Council Room card allows a player to draw 4 cards, increase buys by 1, and every other player also draws a card. This is implemented by a for loop for the player drawing a card, a statement that increments buys by 1, and another for loop where every player who is not the current Player draws one card.
I introduced a bug where the buys increase by 1 and every other player also draws a card with every card the current player draws, by putting the code to increase buys and for other players to draw cards inside the for loop that implements the action of the player drawing a card. 
newSteward()
The Steward card allows the player to choose from one of the following – draw 2 cards, gain 2 coins, or trash 2 cards from the hand. I introduced a bug in the code where the program checks to see what the currentPlayer’s choice is. I changed the “equal to” operator to the assignment operator, so now choice 1 will always be equal to ‘1’.
