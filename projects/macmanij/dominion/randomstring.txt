Random Test Quiz 2

inputchar() creates an array containing the letters of the alphabet and the
special symbols {, [, (, ), ], } and space. The rand() function is used to 
choose a random number between 0-33 to pick a random element in the array.
Since rand() is seeded in main(), it's not necessary in this function.
The random character is returned, and eventually as they are found the 
'state' variable will be incremented stepwise until it is '9'. 

inputstring() chooses a random number between 0-9 and depending on the result
will return one of ten random strings hard-coded. If the number is '9' then
'result' is returned. Once the 'state' variable is '9' and the string is set
to 'reset' the error will occur. Most of my test runs have this happening 
between iterations 250-300.
