cardtest1: 
line 33: the played Smithy card was trashed when it was supposed to be discarded.

cardtest3: 
line 29: the card to be trashed ends up staying in the hand.  Caused by typo where "i" was used instead of "j" in a condition statement.
line 43: the function should have failed due to trying to gain a card that's too expensive.  Caused by a flipped less than sign in the comparison that determined whether the card is cheap enough to be gained.

cardtest4:
lines 26, 42, 60, 80: the Adventurer card never gets discarded (put into the played pile)
line 29, 46, 67, 84: the hand count is one more than it should be because the adventurer card that was played is still in the hand.
lines 62, 65: discardCount and deckCount were off because it was attempting to draw 3 treasure cards instead of only 2, causing it to draw and discard another non-treasure card.  Caused by "<=" in place of a "<" when determining how many treasures have already been drawn.
