Smithy: This card costs 4 currency and when played the player draws 3 cards.  When the int getCost function is called, it takes a cardNumber.  When the smithy cardNumber is passed, the getCost function returns 4.  This corresponds to the amount of the smithy card.  Then when the cardEffect function is called, if the card name smithy is passed, a loop containing the function drawCard is looped 3 times using a for loop.
Adventurer: This card costs 4 currency and when played the player reveals cards from his or her deck until 2 treasurer cards are revealed.  These 2 cards are then put into the player's hand and the rest are discarded.  When the int getCost function is called, it takes a cardNumber.  When the Adventurer cardNumber is passed, the getCost function returns 6.  This corresponds to the amount of the Adventurer card. Then when the cardEffect function is called, if the card name adventurer is passed, a loop runs until the number of treasure cards equals 2.  The loop first checks if the deck is empty and if so, the shuffle function is called.  After the deck is shuffled, the drawcard function is called.  Then the card is examined to see if it is a treasure card.  If it is, then the "drawntreasure" variable is incremented, which keeps track of how many treasures have been drawn.  If it is not, then the card is put into the "temphand" array.  After the first loop, a second loop discards the cards in the temphand using 
the function discardCard.  discardCard first checks to make sure the card passed is not trashed (trashFlag = 0).  If it is not trashed it is added to the play pile using the array playedCards. Then the function uses if statements to see how many cards are left in the player's hand.  If 0 or 1, then the handCount variable is decremented to reduce the number of cards in the hand.  If more than one, then last card in the hand replaced the discarded card.
updateCoins() resets the coin count (using state->coins).  Then a loop checks each card to see if it is copper, silver, or gold and adds the appropriate amount to state->coins.  After this loop, the bonus is added.
