Adventurer card: This card lets the player draw cards from their 
deck until they draw two treasure cards of any value. Any non-treasure
cards are discarded. If the deck runs out before two treasure cards
are drawn, the rest of the deck is reshuffled and the drawing continues. 

Smithy card: This card lets the player draw the next three cards from
the top of their deck and add them to their hand. If the deck runs out 
before the three cards are drawn, the rest of the deck is reshuffled 
and the rest of the cards are drawn from the new deck.

discardCard(): This method looks at a card and determines if the card 
is to be removed from the game or if the card has been played. If the card 
has not been trashed, the card is removed from the player's hand and 
added to the played pile. 

updateCoins(): This method looks at all of the values of the treasure cards
held by the player and adds up the total worth of those cards. It also adds 
any bonus coins provided by a card to give the player the total coins they 
are able to spend that turn.
