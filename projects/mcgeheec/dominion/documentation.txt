smithy card:
	The function drawCard() is called 3 times. The function discardCard() is called on the position where the smithy
	card is.

adventure card:
	The program enters a while loop until the number of treasure cards drawn reaches 2. If the card drawn is a treasure,
	the number of treasure cards in incremented. Else the card is added to a temporary hand. After the 2 treasure cards
	have been drawn, the cards that are in the temporary hand are discarded.

discardCard():
	If the trashCard flag is not set, then the card is put into the pile of cards that have been played. The value of the
	card at the position where the card was is set to -1. If the position where the card was in the player's hand is the last 
	position, the number of cards in the players hand is simply decremented. If there was only one card in the player's hand, 
	then the number of cards is also decremented. If neither of those is the case, then the last card in the hand is moved to
	the position where the discarded card was and the number of cards is decremented.

updateCoins():
	This function takes as input the number of the player, the state of the game, and the coin bonus that the player has.
	At the beginning of the function, the number of coins is set to 0. Then each card is looked at and if it is a copper,
	1 coins is added to the number of coins; if it is a silver, 2 coins are added; and if it is a gold, 3 coins are added.
	Then the coin bonus is added to the number of coins. This will be zero unless the player played an action card that
	gives a coin bonus.
