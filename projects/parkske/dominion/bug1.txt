Bug 00001: 
    Summary: 
        A deadlock case occurs when doAdventurer attempts to drawCard but the deck is empty. Shuffle will return -1
        and the discard pile is not moved into the deck and shuffled.
    Priority:
        High
    Severity:
        Low
    How to Reproduce:
        Call the cardEffect > doAdventurer with deckCount <= 0.
    Expected Outcome:
        The empty deck is recombined with the discard and shuffled to make more cards available.
    Actual Outcome:
        Shuffle exits when the deck is empty, so doAdventurer is not able to complete its drawCard
        routine for gathering treasure cards.
