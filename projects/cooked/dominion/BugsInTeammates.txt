Smithy card testing:
 To run my tests on Davids Smithy card I only had to change the function 
 name in my testing code. No major changes were required.

 100% statement and 100% branch coverage of pSmithy() using cardtest1.c
 smithyTest(): HandCount was not properly incremented.
 bug1: It is only drawing 2 cards instead of 3.

Adventurer card testing:
 To run my tests on Davids Adventurer card I only had to change the function
 name in my testing code. No major changes were required.

 100% statement coverage and 87% branch coverage of pAdventurer() using
 cardtest2.c
 adventureTest(): There was a problem putting treasure cards into the players
 hand

 bug1: It is looping up until it has drawn 3 treasure cards.
 bug2: There is a discardCard() call in the shuffle control loop for some reason,
 	   this is going to cause an unintentional loss of cards.
 bug3: The cardDrawn is being improperly declared, it is pointing to the second 
 	   to last card drawn instead of the last.
 bug4: estate cards are being counted as treasure cards
 bug5: discardCard() call at the end is trsahing the card, instead of placing
 	   it in the played card stack

Council Room testing:
 To run my tests on Davids Concil Room card I only had to change the function
 name in my testing code. No major changes were required.

 100% statement and 100% branch coverage of pCouncilRoom() using cardtest3.c
 councilroomTest(): Error incrementing the number of buys

 bug1: Iterating one player too far in the 'draws a card' loop, going out of
       player count bounds
 bug2: Incrementing number of buys everytime another player draws a card, 
 	   which is inadvertently increasing the current players number of buys
 	   to a much higher value than intended

Smithy card testing:
 To run my tests on Howards Smithy card I had to change the function call 
 by adding the current players turn, and swapping around the call parameters.

 100% statement and 100% branch coverage of cardSmithy() using cardtest1.c
 smithyTest(): Smithy was not discarded properly

 bug1: Smithy is not in the played card pile
 bug2: Since smithy is still in the hand, an inappropriate number of cards
 	   were drawn

Adventurer card testing:
 To run my tests on Howards Adventurer card I had to change the function call
 by adding the current players turn, and removing the hand position (suspicious).

 100% statement coverage and 73% branch coverage of cardAdventurer using
 cardtest2.c
 adventureTest(): There was a problem putting treasure cards into the players hand
 adventureTest(): Adventurer card was not discarded from hand

 bug1: Treasure card count is incorrect
 bug2: Adventurer ard was not discarded (We dont even know the hand positon!)
