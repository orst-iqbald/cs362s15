void adventurerCard(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos);

void smithyCard(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos);

void villageCard(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos);

void great_hallCard(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos);

void outpostCard(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos);
