ADVENTURER CARD
Created a new function:
void zzzadventurercardplay(int drawntreasure, int currentPlayer, int cardDrawn, int temphand[MAX_HAND], int z, struct gameState* state)
with a call to that function where the code previous was in cardEffect()
[line 668] Changed the while condition from (z - 1 >= 0) to (z >= 0) which may cause z to decrease in value.

====================

SMITHY CARD
Created a new function:
void zzzsmithycardplay(int i, int currentPlayer, int handPos, struct gameState* state)
with a call to that function where the code previous was in cardEffect()
Changed the 0 to a 1 in the call to discardCard. Now instead of placing the card in the discard pile, the card will be trashed.

====================

GREAT HALL CARD
Created a new function:
void zzzgreathallcardplay(int currentPlayer, int handPos, struct gameState* state)
with a call to that function where the code previous was in cardEffect()
No bugs introduced

====================

REMODEL CARD
Created a new function:
int zzzremodelcardplay(int i, int j, int choice1, int choice2, int currentPlayer, int handPos, struct gameState* state)
with a call to that function where the code previous was in cardEffect()
Changed the return statement from -1 to 1.

====================

STEWARD CARD
Created a new function:
void zzzstewardcardplay(int choice1, int choice2, int choice3, int currentPlayer, int handPos, struct gameState* state)
with a call to that function where the code previous was in cardEffect()
Changed the else-if statement from (choice1 == 2) to (choice1 > 1). As a result the else statement will likely never be reached.
