All functions tested passed using assertions to test each.

Card functions weren't so lucky, due to introduced bugs. Each one tested
displayed the bugs that were introduced, which also cause other issues in
some cases.

In the newSmithy card, the number of cards in hand should have incremented by 3, but
instead incremented by 2, which was checked for two players playing the newSmithy card.
Both returned errors with the result displayed.
TESTING newSmithy() card:
	Failed - Player 0 number of cards in hand incorrect. Expected = 7, Returned = 8
	Failed - Player 1 number of cards in hand incorrect. Expected = 2, Returned = 3
FINISHED newSmithy() card:

The newAdventurer card failed to retrieve the proper number of treasure cards from the
temp hand. This was tested against two players and in each case, the number retrieved
was one more than expected, as shown below.
TESTING newAdventurer() card:
	Failed - Player 0 number of treasure cards incorrect. Expected = 5, Returned = 6
	Failed - Player 1 number of treasure cards incorrect. Expected = 2, Returned = 3
FINISHED newAdventurer() card:

The newBaron card was supposed to increment the players ability to buy by two, but instead
only incremented by one, shown below. In addition player two's estate card was chosen to be discarded,
however it was never discarded which displayed a bug shown below.
TESTING newBaron() card:
	Failed - Player 0 buy not incremented properly: Expected 2, Returned 1
	Failed - Player 1 buy not incremented properly: Expected 2, Returned 1
	Failed - Player 1 estate count not decremented after choosing to discard. Expected = 1, Returned = 2
FINISHED newBaron() card:

newCutpurse was tested and it should have incremented the players coins by 2, instead it only
incremented the coin count by 1. In addition to that error, the second player should have had
a copper card discarded, but the copper card count remained the same in the end as shown below.
TESTING newCutpurse() card:
	Failed - Player 0 coins did not increment properly: Expected 6, Returned 5
	Failed - Player 1 copper cards did not decrement properly: Expected 3, Returned 3
FINISHED newCutpurse() card:
