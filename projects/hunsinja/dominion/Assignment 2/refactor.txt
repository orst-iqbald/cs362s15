##### Functions added and relavent details #####
>>> Smithy <<<
int smithyCard (struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos)
{...}

*Bugs:
-changed for loop to "for (i = 0; i <= 3; i++)" so that the function would mistakenly draw 4 cards


>>> Adventurer <<<
int adventurerCard (struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer)
{...}

*Bugs:
-changed while loop to "while(z-1 > 0)" which will leave one drawn card in the player's hand


>>> Council Room <<<
int councilroomCard (struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos)
{...}

*Bugs:
-removed if statement in for loop to give each other player a card so current player also gets a card


>>> Village <<<
int villageCard (struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos)
{...}

*Bugs:
-removed the discardCard(...) function so that the card is never discarded


>>> Great Hall <<<
int greathallCard (struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos)
{...}

*Bugs:
-adds two additional actions instead of one
