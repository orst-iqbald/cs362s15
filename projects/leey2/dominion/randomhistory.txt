	The variables that I generated randomly in my random tests are the number of players, the hand count and the bonus. (I included random seed in the code to get better random values) To get better coverage and improve the effectiveness of my tests, I increased the upper limit of these variables to following: the max number of players to 4, the max hand count to 10 and the max bonus to 10, and also each test runs 10000 (loops) times. To be honest, this change did not seem to increase the coverage very much as I only saw very little increase here and there when I increased above values and the number of loops each test runs.
	The biggest concern I had was the fact that the bug I introduced to the adventurer card did not yield an error with my tests as I should. I tried different number of variables, different variation of state conditions, and even increased the number of loops to 1000000, but it still did not yield the error I wanted so to make sure that the bug I introduced was correct and should work as I intended, I rechecked it and it was fine. At this point I do not know what to attribute this other than the fact that this error occurs in very rare occasion and I’m excited to see how my classmate will find this bug if that is the case.
