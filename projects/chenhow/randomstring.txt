Basically, the testme() function will only progress through states 1-9 if the
conditional statements are met. The first 9 conditional statements has 2
requirements:
    1. The random character generated from inputChar() has to equal the
          character specified in the conditional statement.
    2. The previous conditional statement has to be met before continuing to
          the next.
          
The last conditional statement will only continue if the character string = 
'reset' and all previous 9 conditional statements are met. 

To pass these tests by randomization, we specify that the inputChar() function
returns a random character. Since the characters we want fall between 32-126
on the ASCII character encoding scheme, we can randomly select a number from
32-126. To get the character, we just return the type casted (char)number.

To pass the test of the final conditional statement of testme() by
randomization, we set the inputString() function to return a 5 character string
that has random sequences of e, r, s, t (only these letters are used to be
able to past the final test). We could use every single character like
inputChar(), but it would probably take days to find the sequence of r,e,s,e,t.
