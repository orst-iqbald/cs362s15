refactor.txt

The five cards I will be refactoring is the smithy, adventurer, remodel, village, and salvager.

Smithy:
	Movee smithy  to an void function outside the switch, called smithy_card then introduced a bug that would allow the person to draw 4 cards changing i=0; i<3 to i=0;i<4. 
Adventurer:
	Moved adventeruer to an void function outside the switch, called adventurer_card, introduced a change to the while loop, from z-1>=0 to z-1>=1 so the card will be trashed.
Village:
	Moved village to an void function outside the switch, called village_card, made it so the card will allow an extra draw
Remodel:
	Moved remodel to an void function outside the switch, I made the case call a new void function remodel_card.
Salvager
	Moved salvager to an void function outside the switch, called salvager_card, made it so that the trashed card is discarded and the salvager is trashed instead of discarded.
