#Card documentation
smithy card:
- 3 cards are drawn from the player's deck and added to their hand.
- The player must discard 1 card from their hand after the drawing.

adventurer card:
- If the current player's deck is empty, the discard is shuffled and added to deck.
- The adventurer card draws cards from the deck until two treasure cards have been drawn (copper|silver|gold), placing those treasure cards into your hand.
- Any non-treasure cards drawn during the process of drawing the two treasure cards are moved to discard after being revealed.
- Note: the deck is not reshuffled once the drawing process has begun.

#Method documentation

- int handPos = position of card to discard in current player's hand
