discardCard() Documentation:
This function is called whenever a card is removed from a player's hand. 

int discardCard(int handPos, int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int trashFlag)

handPos - An integer indicating the position in the player's hand-array of the card that is leaving the player's hand.
currentPlayer - An integer indicating from which player's hand the card is leaving.
state - A pointer to the struct holding all of the game-state information. 
trashFlag - An integer indicating whether or not the card is going to the discard pile or the trash pile.

If the card is not being trashed, it gets added to the list of cards played this turn, held in the game-state struct.
The card's place in the player's hand is filled with the value -1 to indicate the card is no longer in his hand.
The cards in the player's hand are then re-ordered (if necessary) so that the remaining cards take up the lowest indices of the hand-array.
The value 0 is returned to indicate the function's success.

updateCoins() Documentation:
This function is called whenever the total number of coins in play changes.

int updateCoins(int player, struct gameState *state, int bonus)

player - An integer indicating the player whose coin total is being updated.
state - A pointer to the struct holding all of the game-state information.
bonus - An integer indicating how many coins are being added to the player's coin total.

The number of coins in play is reset to 0.
Coins are then added to the total number of coins in play for each treasure card in the player's hand (1 for copper, 2 for silver, 3 for gold).
Coins are then added to the total number of coins in play equal to the value of bonus. 
The value 0 is returned to indicate the function's success.

Adventurer Card Documentation:
When a card is chosen to be played, the cardEffect() function executes, using a switch to determine which actions to take for the chosen card.

For the Adventurer card, the following actions take place.

Until two treasure cards are drawn, the drawCard() function is called, adding a card to the player's hand.
If the deck needs to be reshuffled to continue drawing, the shuffle() function is called.
If the drawn card is not a treasure, it is removed from the player's hand and stored in a temp-hand. 
Once two treasures have been drawn, the temp-hand is discarded.
