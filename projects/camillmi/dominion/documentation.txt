# Adventurer Card

The adventurer card costs 5 coins. The of effect of Adventurer is to require the 
player to reveal cards from his deck until two Treasure cards are revealed. The
Treasure cards are added to his hand and the others are discarded. The code for
this process works with one card at a time, determining whetehr is is a 
Treasure card and adding it to the hand or discarding as appropriate. A while
loop is used to stop after two Treasure cards are drawn.
