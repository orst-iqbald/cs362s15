Bug #00001: 
    Summary: 
        Seg fault occurs due to decrementing of player's hand count
    Priority:
        High
    Severity:
        High
    How to Reproduce:
        Call effectAdventurer in succession many times with a valid deck to draw from. The deck
		shall not contain treasure cards or only contain treasure cards near the "end" so that
		drawnTreasure is called many times.
    Expected Outcome:
        The handCount shall be no more than 1 card larger in size and no less than 1 card less in size.
		The handCount cannot be less than 0.
		When 2 treasure cards are added and the adventurer card discarded = 1 card larger
		When 0 treasure cards are drawn and the adventurer card discarded = 1 card less
    Actual Outcome:
        The handCount is decremented with every attempt to draw a treasure card. Line 1234 is doing
		this as it uses the decrement unary operator when dereferencing the card in the "top" of the
		hand. This is decrementing the state->handCount[currentPlayer] count.
		
Bug #00002: 
    Summary: 
        Steward cardEffect doesn't handle trashcard case when hand count <= 2 before playing card
    Priority:
        High
    Severity:
        Medium
    How to Reproduce:
        Call cardEffect using steward card when handCount <= 2.
    Expected Outcome:
		The handCount cannot be less than 0.
		Available cards other than the steward card are trashed. The steward card will be discarded.
		If no more cards are available to trash, the trash discard step is skipped.
    Actual Outcome:
        cardEffect -> steward discards whatever is provided in choice2 and choice3, which results
		in handCount being decremented beyond the logical bound of 0.

Bug #00003: 
    Summary: 
        Treasure count in effectAdventurer cannot be calculated
    Priority:
        High
    Severity:
        Medium
	Related To: 
		#00001
    How to Reproduce:
        Call cardEffect with adventurer and check treasure count in hand afterwards.
    Expected Outcome:
		The hand to contain up to 2 additional treasure cards
    Actual Outcome:
        The treasure count always returns 0. Likely due to calculation depending on handCount that
		is being set to erroneous values by #00001.
		
Bug #00004: 
    Summary: 
        effectSmithy fails to discard after running
    Priority:
        High
    Severity:
        Low
    How to Reproduce:
        Call cardEffect with smithy card. Monitor handCount and discard count
    Expected Outcome:
		3 cards are gained, 1 card is discarded: net +2 cards in hand
    Actual Outcome:
        3 cards are gained, 0 cards are discarded: net +3 cards in hand
