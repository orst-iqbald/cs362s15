Smithy Card:
I changed the loop to provide 2 cards instead of 3 cards.

Adventurer Card:
Defined 'cardDrawn' here, but left undefined in the orginal cardEffect section. 

Feast Card:
Defined 'x' here, but left undefined in the original cardEffect section.

Council Room Card:
Defined 'i' here, but left undefined in the original cardEffect section. Also, changed to give +5 instead of +4

Remodel Card

I picked these cards becuase they were towards the top and seemed fairly easy to change. Some of my changes are sort of repetitive and simple, but when working with large amounts of code such as this, these minor changes can be the largest.
