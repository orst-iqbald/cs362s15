Code coverage for unit tests

cardtest1 - smithy
- The unit tests result in 100% coverage.

cardtest2 - adventurer
- The unit tests result in 100% coverage.

cardtest3 - council room
- The unit tests result in 100% coverage.

cardtest4 - cutpurse
- The unit tests result in 47% coverage.
This test did not get all branches. One reason is the DEBUG option was not set, so it did not go into that statement, although this is not an important branch to enter.
For some reason, despite giving a player an entire hand of coppers, the code never enters the branch on line 729, which discards the current card if it is a copper. I can't tell if this is an issue with my code, or if it is an issue with the original code. However, it somehow still passes the test of removing the coppers.

unittest1 - updateCoins
- The unit test resulted in 100% coverage.

unittest2 - discardcard
- The unit test resulted in 88% coverage.
This test failed to get the branch at line 1281. However, this is due to an impossible condition set by the original code. It first checks if the handPos of the card is the last in the hand. If it is the only card in hand, then it logically follows it is also the last card in the hand. Due to this, it never hits the else-if statement of the card being the only card in hand. However, both of these branches do the same thing.

unittest3 - endTurn
- The unit test resulted in 100% coverage.

unittest4 - buyCard
- The unit test resulted in 76% coverage; however, the only branches it does not enter are the DEBUG statements, meaning 100% of the branches of the actual functionality of the function were called.
