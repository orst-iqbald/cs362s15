* Description: Bug report for Unit and Card tests
*************************/
-I seemed to have some slight problems in testing my card functions, as was sometimes
adding a weird number of card to the hand, instead of following what I had specified
in the functions in dominion.c I had added, and the bugs that were introduced didn't seem
to have as great an effect as intended. 

****************
unittest1: shuffle()
	-No bugs were found in this function during tests

****************
unittest2: isGameOver()
	-No bugs were found in this function during tests

****************
unittest3: kingdomCards()
	-No bugs were found in this function during tests

****************
unittest4: buyCard()
	-No bugs were found in this function during tests

****************
cardtest1: smithy
	-Test fails, as it adds 4 cards to the hand instead of 3, as the bug I put in previously.
	It also doesn't discard it properly, as I have it being trashed instead.

****************
cardtest2: adventurer
	-Test fails, as it adds incorrect amount of treasure cards to the hand

****************
cardtest3: Cutpurse
	-Sometimes fails, as the incorrect number of gold has been added to the hand. There are
	also times the incorrect amount of copper is discarded.

****************
cardtest4: Village
	-Test fails, as it subtracts actions instead of giving the player 2
