CS 362 Assignment 4

randomtestadventurer.c
The following lines are not necessary because draw card will shuffle if needed.
       if (pre.deckCount[currentPlayer] <1){//if the deck is empty we need to shuffle discard and add to deck
            shuffle(currentPlayer, &pre);
        }
I removed the lines from my test file but left them in the original dominion.c after that I was able to get 100% coverage on my test file. I played with introducing bugs into the adventurer card and as expected it would cause an issue with my assert statement as the oracle would not match the changed state. One example is the bug I introduced into adventurer card in the first assignment. I had to remove this bug in order to get my tests to pass. Also, this was the only card I was unable to get to be a random tester in the previous assignment and it proved to be tricky to get the hand set up correctly.
randomtestcard.c
The second card I wrote a test case for was the smithy card. This card was much easier to complete as I had already been able to achieve a random test for this card in the previous assignment. Test coverage was obviously the same in this case. I placed a couple bugs into the smithy card to test the effectiveness of the tester and it successfully found each of the bugs I introduced
