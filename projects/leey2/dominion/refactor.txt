5 cards I refactored are: Smithy, Adventurer, Village, Gardens, Sea_hag.

I took them out of the switch statement then made them into separate functions. These functions are called if the card matches in if-else statements, if not then the switch statement is called.


I introduced a bug to following 4 cards:

-Smithy = if handCount is bigger 5, the player gets to draw another card.

-Adventurer = Increase the drawntreasure count by 2 instead of 1 if the cardDrawn is gold.

-Village = Gives 3 actions instead of 2.

-Sea_hag = Does  not decrease the deckCount.
