UNIT TEST 1: discardCard

File 'dominion.c'
Lines executed:21.73% of 566
Branches executed:18.80% of 415
Taken at least once:15.66% of 415
Calls executed:10.31% of 97

Function 'discardCard'
Lines executed:92.31% of 13
Branches executed:100.00% of 6
Taken at least once:83.33% of 6
No calls

A fairly thorough test of discardCard. I was able to detect the errors in it. It appears that the only
line I failed to execute was the one triggered by the conditional checking to see if you have only one
card in your hand. I do put the function through this circumstance, but it triggered the preceding
conditional as well, and so it bypassed this else if check.


UNIT TEST 2: isGameOver

File 'dominion.c'
Lines executed:17.49% of 566
Branches executed:17.83% of 415
Taken at least once:14.94% of 415
Calls executed:7.22% of 97

Function 'isGameOver'
Lines executed:100.00% of 10
Branches executed:100.00% of 8
Taken at least once:100.00% of 8
No calls

I fully put this function through its paces I think.



UNIT TEST 3: fullDeckCount

File 'dominion.c'
Lines executed:17.31% of 566
Branches executed:18.80% of 415
Taken at least once:15.90% of 415
Calls executed:7.22% of 97

Function 'fullDeckCount'
Lines executed:100.00% of 9
Branches executed:100.00% of 12
Taken at least once:100.00% of 12

Again, I feel confident that my test of this function did a good job of examining
all aspects of it.


UNIT TEST 4: getWinners

File 'dominion.c'
Lines executed:24.56% of 566
Branches executed:31.81% of 415
Taken at least once:25.06% of 415
Calls executed:9.28% of 97

Function 'getWinners'
Lines executed:95.83% of 24
Branches executed:100.00% of 22
Taken at least once:95.45% of 22
Calls executed:100.00% of 2

It looks like the only area I failed to test was a circumstance where there are fewer
than 4 active players and the non-active players have their values set to -9999. Other
than that, I think that the test for getWinners is fairly thorough based on these results.
