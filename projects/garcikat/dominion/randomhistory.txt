*** randomtestadventurer ***
I was lucky in that for the last assignment (Assignment 3) 
that I had wrote random tests for the adventurer card. After 
I had re-watched the random test videos I made some significant 
changes. One of the main changes that I did was instead of 
randomizing each byte in the gameStruct, I just used the 
initializeGame function and randomize all the deck, discard 
and hand cards. Another change that I did was to halve all the 
random numbers for the main gameStruct states (deckCount, 
discardCount, handCount) so that I could get some somewhat 
realistic values for each. I also saved the pre-test states to 
use in expected results calculations after the tests. I also 
changed the test results to print from the test function and 
not main. Another significant change that I did was inside 
the test function itself. Instead of comparing a pre and 
post gameStruct, I just compared the post gameStruct to 
expected values to determine if the tests passed or failed.
For each test iteration I printed the pre, post and 
expected game states.

I did make one more change, and I am not sure if that was 
what is expected out of this assignment. I couldn't compile 
my code because of the bugs that I introduced at the beginning 
of this course. I realize now I should have done less syntax 
error and more game errors (like drawing too many cards).
I fixed the bugs that I wrote so that I could run my tests. 
After fixing some more spelling and syntax errors
with my test code, I got all the tests to pass. 

Here are my results when I run gcov randomtestadventurer.c -b:
File 'dominion.c'
Lines executed: 89% of 584
Branches executed: 19.66% of 417
Taken at least once: 17.03% of 417
Calls executed: 8.51% of 94
dominion.c:creating 'dominion.c.gcov'

File 'randomtestadventurer.c'
Lines executed: 86.21% of 58
Branches executed: 100.0% of 24
Taken at least once: 83.33% of 24
Calls executed: 82.61% of 23
randomtestadventurer.c:creating 'randomtestadventurer.c.gcov'

For the most part I am kind of content with my test. 
Looking at the gcov file, my coverage is somewhat decent. 
The problem is that every test passed and my fail test 
lines are never executed. I wish I would have introduced 
some bugs and maybe played with the deck, discard, and 
hand count a little more (change some values to zero perhaps).


*** randomtestcard *** (the Smithy Card)
I made a lot of the same changes to testing the smithy card 
that I did with randomtestadventurer. I changed the test function,
made pre and post test calculations for expected results, 
and cut out comparing a pre gameStruct to the post gameStruct in 
the test function. 

Again I couldn't run my code until I fixed the bugs I made 
earlier, so I went ahead an fixed them. I wish I would have
introduced different bugs so that my tests would produce better results.

I reached a problem when running gcov. It says my gcno 
file is corrupted. I am not sure what happened. The tests run fine
but for some reason running gcov is giving me an error.
