CS362 Assignment 4

I did random test for adventurer and smithy. The loop runs 100 times for 4 players. For each draw, a random card is draw randomly from the card pool and given to a player. Player's deck is emptied and filled with 20 random cards. The players game state before and after drawing cards are recorded, including actions, hand count, coins, and cards in hand. The random tests for adventurer and smithy were able to find unexpected results, indicating bugs have been introduced into the code.

The code coverage for file "dominion.c" by using randomtestadventurer is:
Lines executed:30.20% of 586
Branches executed:29.69% of 421
Taken at least once:21.62% of 421
Calls executed:20.83% of 96

The code coverage for file "dominion.c" by using randomtestcard(smithy) is:
Lines executed:33.28% of 586
Branches executed:31.59% of 421
Taken at least once:23.04% of 421
Calls executed:23.96% of 96

Coverage of the entire "dominion.c" code is not relevant because the purpose of these random tests is to cover the specific functions.  According to the detailed coverage information in the dominion.c.gcov file, the statement coverages for adventurer and smithy functions are good, and branches within the tested functions have been covered thoroughly. Overall, code coverage by random test is comparable to code coverage by unit test.
