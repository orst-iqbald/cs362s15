Random Card: Smithy

I wrote a random tester that generates different possible scenarios wherein a smithy could be played in order to
draw three cards. I randomly determine which player will be performing the action and where in his hand the smithy
is located. I then store the number of cards in the player's hand, call the smithy function, and compare the
number of cards now shown to be in the players hand to my calculated control value (previous hand size + 2). This test
has 100% coverage for the Smithy and shows it to work 100% of the time without failure.


Adventurer:

My random tester for the adventurer was built on top of the skeletal structure I had produced in my Smithy random tester.
Because the adventurer also has the player draw cards, the same framework was applicable. I have the Adventurer played
by different players, but this time I did not vary the position of the card in the player's hand as that information was
not taken into account by the function call. I first randomly scatter coppers, silvers, and golds throughout the player's
deck. I put only 2 treasure cards into a deck that has 100 cards totals. All cards that are not treasure cards are set to
be estates. After preparing the deck with this insertion of two random treasures, I cycle through every card of the deck
and tally how many coppers, silvers, and golds are encountered. Based on this information, I know what the expected monetary
value of the two cards being drawn is. I compare the coin value of the hand after the Adventurer is played to the value
I expected based on a determination of which treasures were present to be drawn.

The adventurer is currently in a bad way. It has a very low success rate due to the bug I introduced in an earlier assignment.
My coverage currently is decent enough to illustrate the problematic section. I feel that trying to build further tests in the
mean time would produce only meaningless results.
