General: The two cards that were used for the random testing were the smithy and adventurer 
		cards. I used the same general process to set up each card's test. There were 100 
		tests run on each card in one calling. And in each new test, a new seed is chosen, 
		a new number of players, whose turn it is, the number of cards in the player's hand, 
		deck and discard pile, and the number of cards played are all randomly chosen. Along with
		where in the player's hand the card being tested is inserted.

randomtestcard.c - smithy

Lines executed:37.26% of 577
Branches executed:35.01% of 417
Taken at least once:25.42% of 417
Calls executed:22.11% of 95

	- For this random test, I used the smithy card. I took my unit test of the smithy card
	and added random variables to it for setting up the game state compared to having a fixed
	state in the previous unit test. I then tested that the correct number of cards were added to 
	the hand, and that the smithy card was discarded and the correct amount of cards were discarded
	from the hand. 
	- Was called 36 times, had 97.67% line coverage and 100% branch coverage. It was an improvement by about 2% 
	on line coverage, branch coverage was the same and was called 24 more times than the unit test. So there was
	an overall improvement with the test, though there was still no 100% line coverage.

randomtestadventurer.c - adventurer

Lines executed:37.26% of 577
Branches executed:35.01% of 417
Taken at least once:25.42% of 417
Calls executed:22.11% of 95

	- For this random test, the adventurer card was used. I also took my previously set up unit test
	of the adventurer card and changed and added in random variables for setting up the game state. I then 
	tested that the correct number of treasure cards were added to the hand and if the correct number of cards
	in general are in the hand after playing the card. 
	- Was called 39 times, had 97.96% line coverage and 100% branch coverage. It was an improvement by just over 7%
	on line coverage, stayed the same for branch coverage and was called 25 more times. So there was a definite improvement
	with the random test compared to the unit test
