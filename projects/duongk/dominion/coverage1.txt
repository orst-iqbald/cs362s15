I expected unittest4, isGameOver(), to recieve the highest coverage percentages and it did. I believed this 
because I felt that I had covered every aspect of the function in my unittest. It is interesting 
to me that the statement coverage and the branch coverage for this test are so similar though. 
I expected the branch coverage to be much higher than statement due to the way that the function works. 

There were several instances where statement coverage was higher than branch coverage, and branch coverage higher than statement coverage. 
This makes sense due to the nature of each "card" or function. For example the Embargo card, cardtest4, showed a large amount of statement
coverage than branch coverage. This is not surprising as the embargo card doesn't have many "branches" to explore in terms of it coverage.
The user can pick up the card, play it, recieve their bounty, and then discard the card. This makes the statement coverage a suitable
type. 

There are also instances such as with fullDeckCount(), unittest3, where branch coverage was more prevalent than statement. When using 
statement coverage on a card like fullDeckCount() I'm confident that you wuold not be able to debug anywhere close to all of the possibilities
of the card. This is because the card has so many possible return values that it can send back, branch coverage would be needed in order
to hit all avenues of the final values.

However, there are instances where both types of coverage, statement and branch, are similar. An example of this is in the smithy card, cardtest1, 
the statement coverage and branch coverage both displayed numbers that are only 0.5% different. I think this is due to the simplicity of the card.
Since the smithy card only requires that you draw 3 cards there are not many avenues for differing possibilities which makes branch coverage
not as effective. Oddly enough branch coverage is the lesser of the two percents, even if it is only by 0.5%. 

All of my tests passed (except for the cards with intentional bugs placed in them) and overall my code coverage was decent. My code 
coverage averaged somewhere in the mid 20's with high's in the low 30's. I would be more pleased had my coverage been higher.
