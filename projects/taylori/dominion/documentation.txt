-- DOCUMENTATION FOR SMITHY, ADVENTURER, discardCard(), AND updateCoins() --

Smithy: The smithy action card allows the play to draw three additional cards, but includes no additional action or buy phases. The smithy card is implemented by calling the drawCard() function three times in succession in a for-loop, and then discarding the smithy card itself using the discardCard() function. 

Adventurer: The adventurer action card uses an outer while-loop to check that the amount of treasure in the current player's hand is less than two. While this is true, the loop checks to see if the deck is empty and requires a reshuffle. After checking the deck and reshuffling if necessary, it draws a card, and checks if that card is a treasure card (i.e. copper, silver, or gold). If so, it increases the amount of drawntreasure and repeats the loop until the amount of treasure cards drawn equals two. Otherwise, it stores the revealed card in a temphand. The adventurer card then loops through the temphand to discard all of the cards that were revealed. 

discardCard(): this function first checks the trash flag, which determines whether or not the card goes into the discard pile or gets trashed, meaning the player cannot play it again later on. The played card is then given a handPos of -1, meaning it cannot be played. The code then removes the card from the player's hand using three conditions: 1) if the card played was the last card in the player's hand, the player's handCount is decremented. 2) if the player has only one card in hand, the handCount is decremented. 3) If there are multiple cards left in the players hand, the hand is set to the position of the next card and then handCount is decremented.  

updateCoins(): this function determines the “value” of the player's treasure cards. It uses a for-loop to check each card in the palyer's hand, and sets the state's coins as follows: 1) copper increments by one, 2) silver increments by two, 3) gold increments by three. If the player has a bonus, that is added in as well.
