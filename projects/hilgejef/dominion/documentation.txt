Smithy:

The Smithy card allows the player who uses it to draw three additional
cards.  It appears in the code in the cardEffect function, and is invoked
within a switch statement.  The statement utilizes a for loop that calls 
the drawCard method each time, and runs three times in total.

Adventurer:

The Adventurer card allows the player who uses it to reveal cards from
their deck until 2 treasure cards are revealed.  The treasure cards are put
into the player's hand while the others are discarded.  It appears in the 
code in the cardEffect function.  A loop is invoked where cards are drawn 
using the drawCard method, and at each iteration drawnTreasure is incremented
if the card is a treasure.  If the card is not a treasure, it gets switched
to a temporary hand which is then discarded at the end of the function.

discardCard():
The discardCard() method takes four values as arguments: the position in the hand 
to discard, the player who discards the card, the game state, and a flag
determining whether or not to trash the card.  First the function checks
whether or not the card is trashed; if it isn't, it's added to the played 
pile and remains in the game.  If the discarded card is the last in the hand,
or is the only card remaining in the hand, then the hand count is simply 
reduced by 1.  Otherwise, it's swapped with the last card in the hand and
then the hand count is reduced by 1.

updateCoins():
The updateCoins() method takes three values as arguments: the player to act
upon, the game state, and a number of bonus coins to add.  The function first
sets the coin count to 0, loops through the player's cards and increments
whenever encounters a treasure card with its respective value.  At the end
of the function, it adds the bonus to the coin count.
