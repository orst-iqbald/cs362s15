Bugs Found

unittest2.c tested the scoreFor() function. It uncovered a bug by showing that
the scores were not what they should be. I believe the bug exists because when
counting the score cards in the deck, the counter increments to the number of
cards in the discard pile and not the number of cards in the deck. This is on 
line 444.

cardtest1.c tested the smithy card. The bug was discovered because there were
not enough cards in the player's hand and too many in the deck. This is because
the playSmithy() function discards 3 cards instead of draws 3 cards and draws 1
instead of discards 1. The lines in error are 1254 and 1257.

cardtest2.c tested the adventurer card. The problem with this card is that there
is one too many cards in the player's hand after playing. This is because the 
playAdventurere() function never discards the adventurer card.

cardtest3.c tested the council room card. This test revealed a bug in the overall
implementation of the game. The way that this code implements the game now, when a 
player is taking his or her turn, the other players have 0 cards in their hand.
According to the rules of the game, the other players should already have 5 cards
in their hand. Other than that, the implementation of council room was correct.
