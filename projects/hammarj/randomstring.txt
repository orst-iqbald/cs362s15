In inputChar(), I just have it randomly return one of the nine characters that are capable of changing the state.  So the state variable will quickly work it's way up to 9.

In inputString(), I get a little more sophisticated.  I create a string with room for five characters and a null character.  Then, in a loop, I assign characters to that string.  In each loop iteration, if I roll a 5 through 9, then the correct character is assigned to that spot.  If I roll a 0 through 4, then I assign a character from "reset" corresponding to the number I rolled (so a 0 yields 'r', a 1 yields 'e', etc.).  Finally after the loop I append a null character to the end.  So, it won't take long for a string with the value of "reset" to be returned.

Once the state is set to 9 and the string returned is "reset", the error message will be produced.
