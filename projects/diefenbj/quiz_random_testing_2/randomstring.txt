I used the principles of a "guided" random tester to implement my testing.
In both the 'inputStr()' function and 'inputChar()' function I implemented
guided testing by randomly choosing 1 of two paths each time the function was
called:
	1. Return a truly random string/character
	2. Return a fixed value that is necessary to procede through the code.

For the inputChar() function, the two possibilities are as follows:
	1. (Random) Generate a random ASCII character (0x00 <= c <= 0x7F) and
		return it.
	2. (Fixed) Randomly return one character from a set list of known
		characters that change the state of the program.

For the inputString() function, the two possibilities are as follows:
	1. (Random) Generate a random-length string (0 <= n <= 50) with random
		characters (0x00 <= c <= 0x7F) and return that.
	2. (Fixed) Return the only "special" string: "reset".

This (practically) ensures that the failing case is met, but also
(practically) ensures that other, random strings/characters are used as well.
