Smithy:
	Placed Smithy card action in its own function, int playSmithy().
	Introduced a bug wherein drawCard() is passed handPos instead of currentPlayer. This will hopefully lead to unexpected behavior if handPos != currentPlayer, or if handPos > MAX_SIZE.

Adventurer:
	Adventurer action now takes place in playAdventurer(). 
	Introduced a bug where the temphand array is recreated every time it is needed, which will result in an infinite loop.

Remodel:
	Remodel action now takes place in playRemodel().
	Introduced a bug wherein gainCard() receives choice1 instead of choice2 as an argument, so the player will receive the card s/he just destroyed.

Minion:
	Minion action now takes place within playMinion().
	Introduced a bug where currentPlayer will draw cards for every player who discards. Effectively this leaves all players but one with empty hands, and one player with a hand exceeding MAX_SIZE.

Cutpurse:
	Cutpurse action now takes place within playCutpurse.
	I did not introduce any bugs intentionally into this function.
