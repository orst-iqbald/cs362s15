Adventurer Random Test:
-----------------------
I noticed there are 3 major branches.

*Empty deck
*<2 treasures drawn
*>2 treasures drawn

To ensure these are regularly hit by testing I randomized the deck size and the contents of the deck.
This is done with the randomizeDeck() function.

The purpose of this unit test is to see if the cards are correctly transferred from the deck to the
discard deck. It should have a greater coverage compared to last time as last time there was no effort
to randomize the deck size. So we should cover the empty deck branch this time as opposed to last time
with not covering it.

Garden Random Test:
-----------------------
There is one branch.

I give it a random deck with random contents of random size. The handsize is also random. I have not
tested this in the past so I cannot say whether or not I have better coverage. But I think I nailed
it with 100% branch coverage. I believe the randomizeDeck() function will ensure I hit all the
logic branches.
