The random test has greater coverage (2% more) compared to the non random version of the unit test, and this was done with only 15 iterations. I suspect coverage to be far greater with a greater amount of iterations.

I also believe that I've uncovered another bug in the adventurerCard() or a adependency -- the hand is not correctly keeping count of the number of cards in hand.

In terms of the function block, 100% was executed compared to 93% from the non random test. This was a great improvement over the original.

The random test did the same on this test, and did no better than the non random unit test. I think the reason for this was the original unit test did a good job at covering the function, so there was not much room for improvement. However, the function was called 15 times with different inputs, thus increasing our confidence.
