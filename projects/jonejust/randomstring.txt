In order to guide the random tester, some knowledge of what you are trying 
to guide it toward is needed. Or at least it helps. 

In order to guide the random characters that increment the state variable
I created an array with the symbols that would eventually be needed. 
Then I generated a random number and if that random number was odd, 
another random number was generated to pick an index of the array with 
the symbols that would eventually be needed. In this way one of the 
random symbols would be chosen approximately 50% of the time. Therefore, 
eventually pick each symbol to move to the next state. 

In order to eventually choose the reset string, a little more guidance
was given. For that an array with the reset string and a null char
was created. A for loop with 6 iterations then places a character
into the array we will be returning each time. Once again, a random
number is generated to determine whether the character needed will
be put in the correct place, or if another completely random
ASCII character will be generated and put in its place. 

For each of the 6 indices of the array (0 to 5) there is a 50%
chance the correct character will go in the array to be returned. 
Therefore, the chance of the entire array being correct is
1/(2^6) power, or 1/64. Just under 2% in this implementation.
