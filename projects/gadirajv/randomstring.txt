It was not specified what the set of random values should be so for the function inputChar(), 
I limited the set of values to {'[', '(', '{', ' ', 'a', 'x', '}', ')', ']'}, as these were 
the given 'c' values to match in the testme function. Limiting it to this set of values limits
the number of iterations and increases the probability of the hitting the error message. 

For inputString() I created an array of characters that contained each of the four available characters
needed for the string "reset" - {r,e,s,t}. The function then creates an array of five characters,
with a for loop to fill in the array at random with one of the letters from the set {r,e,s,t}.
