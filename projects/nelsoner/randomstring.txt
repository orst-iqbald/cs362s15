For the testme.c functions inputChar() and inputString(), it was necessary to have the random testers produce random results that would not be 100% random as they would almost never achieve the necessary constraints in the testme function. 
The first function, inputChar(), is a tester that finds a number between 0-256 and then type casts this as a char so that the integer will be converted into ASCII. That way it will find the values on average 1 in 256 attempts.
The second function, inputString(), sets up a string of size 6 and then randomizes the first 5 letters. The number range provided is the number range that corresponds to the lowercase set of ASCII letters. The randomized number is again typecasted into a char so that the letter representation will be found. The last item in the string buffer is simply left as the required letter and not randomized.
