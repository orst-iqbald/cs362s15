RandomHistory

Adventurer:
	In order to test the adventurer card, I randomize the relevant facets of the gameState struct and test for the appropriate number of treasure cards in the player's hand.
	
Steward:
	For this card I check that the player choices yield the correct results, either that the cards are the expected number, or that the coins are adjusted properly.
	
For both cards, I found a way to output the contents of the struct in their entirety - similar to a var_dump in PHP. This can help with debugging, because you can investigate which combinations of values result in a failure case.

To improve coverage, I increased the number of test cases to 1,000,000. This seems to cover all of the required branches.
