I expected my coverage percentages to rise a little from the original testing we did last week, and they did.
The coverage for adventurer rose slighty and the differences in branch vs statement coverage stayed relatively the same. 
When implementing the random testing for the adventurer card I ran in to a bus error and seg fault error for a long period of time. 
I was randomizing all the values of the gamestate and passing them in to the adventurer function to test it with all kinds of different scenarios. 
However, my loop that was running the testing would seg fault everytime it looped to iteration 10. 

On interation 10, the for loop would restart itself at iteration 1, finish its loop and then throw a seg fault on the return statement. 
I was able to fix this by limiting the number of iterations to 9. I attempted to debug this several times in several different ways but was unable to find a solution in the time given. 
Aside from that, my random testing did return bugs that my adventurer card contains.

There were no bugs to be found in the great_hall card as per my random testing. Below are my coverage statistics 
for the two random test implementations.
