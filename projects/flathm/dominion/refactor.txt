Five cards: adventurer, smithy, great_hall, council_room, village

adventurer:
Bug: The while loop has a condition that is supposed to count the number of drawn treasure cards from the deck.
The bug included in this function is that it will now only draw 1 treasure card, since the variable drawntreasure
is initialized to 1;

smithy:
Bug: The smithy card is supposed to draw 3 cards. Within the for loop the index will stop after drawing 4 cards since the 
index must be <= 3. The correct version must be less than 3 since the index starts from 0.

great_hall:
Bug: Instead of adding 1 action, the card now includes 2 actions to the struct->numActions

village:
Bug: The trash flag is activated in the discardCard() function!
