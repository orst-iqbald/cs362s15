Quiz 2 - randomstring test using testme.c

inputChar()
    This function I kept simple. It simply uses the ASCII table to
    generate a value that is between the ' ' character and the ~
    character, which includes all letters as well as all the characters
    that appear in the testme() functions state changes

inputString()
    This function is a bit more involved. I created a string called
    reset that holds "reset", as well as another string that I assign 6
    spaces too.
    The idea here is that I use a random number generator to, 1/1000
    times, just return the string holding "reset" (otherwise it could
    run hundreds of thousands of iterations before constructing the
    string reset by itself). I figured this was necessary since while
    random testing is random, it should also be controlled so that it
    doesn't get out of control.
    The times when it doesn't just return "reset", it uses inputChar() to
    construct a random string with '\0' at the end and returns that.

testme()
    This runs the test, and uses inputChar() to get characters each
    iteration where it first looks for '[' to change the state to 1,
    then '(' to change to state 2, and so on until state 9, where
    it begins checking the string returned by inputString. If the string
    is "reset" here, it exits with an error.
