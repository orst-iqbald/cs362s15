Smithy - For loop changed from for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) to for (i = 0; i <= 3; i++). This bug will add 
4 cards to the players hand instead of 3.

Adventurer - While loop for drawntreasure < 2 changed to drawntreasure <= 2. This bug will cause the
player to draw until 3 treasure cards are found instead of 2.

While loop while(z-1>=0) changed to while(z-1 > 0).

Cutpurse - updateCoins(currentPlayer, state, 2) changed to updateCoins(currentPlayer, state, 3).
This bug causes the player to gain 3 coins instead of 2 when this card is played.

Sea Hag - If statement if(i != currentPlayer) changed to (i == currentPlayer). Will give curse
card to current player instead of all players EXCEPT the current player with this bug.

Village - No changes (requirement is 4 of 5 refactored cards changed.)
