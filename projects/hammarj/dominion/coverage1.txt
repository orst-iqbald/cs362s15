I wasn't able to cover line 1291 in discardCard() because it is impossible to cover.  The conditional that precedes it overlaps completely with it, so it will never be executed.  Lines 1230-1231 also didn't get covered because a bug on the preceding line makes it impossible to execute those lines with all but a few specific cards in particular hand positions.  On line 1152 in cardAventurer, I neglected to test it with copper, but this would have made no difference because silver and gold work in the same way.  Other than that, I managed to cover all statements and take all branches (as far as I could tell).  This excellent coverage doesn't guarantee that my test suite is good, but it does mean that I'm at least off to a good start.
