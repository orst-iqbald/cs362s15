This document outlines the changes I've made to 5 action cards that I've refactored.

1. smithy

Added bug where 4 cards are added to the player's hand instead of 3. 

2. adventurer

Added bug where treasure is drawn until drawnTreasure is <= 2, instead of just < 2.
This should loop an extra time and yield 3 treasure cards for the player instead of
just 2. Also added bug where the temporary hand is not fully discarded, which should
result in the player ending up with an extra non-treasure card in their hand in most
situations.

3. cutpurse

Added bug that causes the player to gain two extra coints. 


4. sea hag

Added bug that causes the player playing the card to receive the curse instead of
all the other characters.


5. village

Refactored code into its own function without (intentionally) adding any bugs.
