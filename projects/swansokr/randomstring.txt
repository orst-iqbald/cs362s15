Steps taken in developing a random tester for testme.c that produces the error:

1. I made sure the characters produced by charInput() were printable (ASCII 32-126).
2. I restricted inputString()'s string length to 6 (so that the \0 would be at s[5]), filling the rest with
	random characters from inputString().
3. I tried restricting the characters that would be put into the string to lowercase alphabetical.
4. I set the string to "reset\0" then replaced a random (0-5, not counting the '\0') number of characters 
	with random characters from inputChar().  This worked.
	
	So the random characters produced from inputChar() cause testme() to progress through the "state"
	values until state = 9; meanwhile, the string will occationally be exactly "reset\0" since one possibility
	is that zero characters in the string will be set to random values.
