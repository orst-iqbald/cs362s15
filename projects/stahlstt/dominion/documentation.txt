Smithy card is an Action card and a Kingdom card.

The card costs 4 coins, and gives an immediate +3 draw from the hand.

In code, the card calls drawCard() 3 times, and then is discarded.

Adventurer card is an Action card and a Kingdom Card
The card costs 6 coins, and allows the player to dig through their deck, 
discarding other cards until 2 treasure cards are found and added to the hand.

In code, the card checks to make sure there is a deck to draw from, and calls
shuffle if the deck is empty. 

Then it draws a card. If that card is a coin card (gold, silver, copper) it 
increments the drawnTreasure counter. If it is not a coin card, then it is put 
aside. 

Once drawnTreasure reaches 2, the other cards are discarded, and updateCoins is 
called to add the value of the two cards found. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
discardCard()
Cards are discarded to a Played pile. Once the current deck is exhausted, the
Played pile is shuffled and becomes the current deick again. 

discardCard() first checks to make sure the card is Discarded, not Trashed. 
then it increments the played card count.

Then, it resets the players hand, in preperation for removing the just played or
discarded card form the hand, taking hand count down by 1.

updateCoins()
There are 3 coin cards: copper, worth 1; silver, worth 2; and gold, worth 3.

updateCoins() sets the total value of coins to 0, then runs through the hand 
array. Each time it encounters a coin card, it adds the appropriate value to 
the coins value. 

Once it is done with the hand, it adds any bonus coins (which
are recieved from playing certain actions).
