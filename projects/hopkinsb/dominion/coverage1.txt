Assignment 3

Due to the bugs mentioned in the bugs1.txt file, many of my tests did not perform very well at all. Some tests, like unittest3 
had very high coverages and others, like cardtest 1 were very low. Most of this was due to my test's inability
to function properly. If you look at the unittestresults.out file, you will see that my overall coverage was very low. This leads
me to think that I need ALOT more practice in unit testing
