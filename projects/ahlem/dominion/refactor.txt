#3
Adventurer Card
       Bug: defined cardDrawn within function, but also left an unused defined cardDrawn variable within the cardEffect function.
Council Room Card
		Bug: Incorrectly adds an additional buy for the player, where it is only supposed to add a single extra buy.
Feast Card
		Bug: defined x within function, but also left an unused defined x variable within the cardEffect function
Smithy Card
		Bug: the for loop will provide 4 cards (instead of the intended 3 cards). This goes against the mechanics of the Dominion game.
