To take from the ASCII table of characters I see the range 32-125 is needed. Using, ‘rand()%94’, I generate a random number from 0-93. Then I add 32 to this value to create the new range of 32-125 and return the integer.I implemented inputString() to return a null-terminated C-string when called. I made a simple character bank containing ‘r’, ’e’, ’s’ and ’t’. A new C-string is made and within a for-loop the characters from the ‘bank’ are randomly positioned. A null terminator character is placed as the last element and the new string is returned.After implementation, I executed the program about twenty five times. The smallest amount of iterations was 533 and the most amount of iterations was 4338.To compile testme.c: gcc -std=c99 testme.c -o testmeTo execute: ./testme
