randomtestadventurer - Once the state has been built and and rand seeded the state is initialized and three functions are used to add cards to the deck, hand (from the deck) and discard piles (from the hand and the deck). The bottom card in the hand ([0]) is turned into and adventurer and the adventurerEffect function is excecuted. After excecution checks are run against ideal values for the end money and deck count and the actual values to determine if the actual value is correct. This is repeated 100 times. Much of the development was looking through the adventurer function and the description of what it should do and setting up checks on any values that should be (or may be) changed. Since the main object being changed is money that is the first value checked, followed by deck size, which ensures that the proper number of cards are drawn, and discard size, which ensures that they all get discarded properly.

randomtestcard - This tests the salvager card. The setup is nearly identical to the adventurer test but we run cardEffect with the int representing the salvager card as the card argument. The ideal and actual values being compared here are the numBuys, coins, and handCount. This test helped me find and error where the discardCard lowers the previous player's handCount.
