testme.c creates a random test that causes the error message to be printed.  The input characters were only evaluated against this subset of 
characters: ('[', '(', '{', ' ', 'a', 'x', '}', ')', ']').
In inputChar() the goal is to select one of those characters and return it.
 
The input string is an array of characters in which the testMe() function evaluates whether the set of characters 
occurs in the following particular sequence:
('r', 'e', 's', 't', '\0').
testMe() checks positions 0-5, and in the inputString() function it allocates memory for a string of 6 characters.
Then it populates each position with a randomly selected character from the set of the characters listed above.
 
You can see that it successfully halts after printing the error message.
Once the testMe() function enters the 'while' loop, it will not exit until it prints the error message. Each iteration calls inputChar()
and inputString() which will then generate new random input for each iteration. The input character is evaluated and if the appropriate
character is discovered, the string is evaluated.  When the characters of the string appear in the order
"reset\0" and the appropriate level (9) is reached, the error message is printed.
