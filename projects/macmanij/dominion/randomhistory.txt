randomtestcard.c was successfully implemented. A game state is instantiated and
the number of cards and treasture cards are counted for a random player in the game.
The smithy card function is called, and then the cards/treasure are checked again.
If the counts are incorrect afterward (if the treasure is less or if the player doesn't
end up with 2 more cards following the discard) the errors are tallied up at the end.
Right now the test iterates 1000 times but that can easily be changed to higher values
to find more errors.

Remaining issues: I can't see to get the .out
files to be created even though I have checked the makefile multiple times. 

randomtestadventurer.c also has yet to be implemented.
