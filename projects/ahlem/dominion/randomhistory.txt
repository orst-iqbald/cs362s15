To run these  programs just 'make randomtestadventurer' and 'make randomtestcard.'
After compiling and running these two files, you can make the .out files by 'make randomtestadventurer.out' and
'make randomtestcard.out.'

These two tests can be very powerful if used correctly.  They allow you to check different variations and states 
of the code.

For the purpose of this assignment, the tests logged the randomly generated gamestate and output an
indication of a failure's occurrence.  Viewing the failed results and the seed allow us to continue with further debugging. 
The end result allows us to replicate and find bugs more easily.

We ran 100 randomly generated games, which is enough to provide meaningful results.
Covered functions included the handCount, deckCount, discardCount, Cardpos, Player, 
playedCardCount, numBuys and whether or not it failed.

randomtestadventurer.c: effectAdventurer() function

File 'dominion.c'
Lines executed:37.46% of 566
Branches executed:33.84% of 396
Taken at least once:26.77% of 396
Calls executed:28.72% of 94
dominion.c:creating 'dominion.c.gcov'

Within the effectAdventurer() function we have 100% branch and statement coverage.
This demonstrates that our random values are being selected in a useful way and is an indication
that the code is being tested successfully.

randomtestcard.c: effectCouncilRoom() function

File 'dominion.c'
Lines executed:37.28% of 566
Branches executed:33.84% of 396
Taken at least once:26.01% of 396
Calls executed:28.72% of 94
dominion.c:creating 'dominion.c.gcov'

These results are very similar to the test coverage from the randomtestadventurer function. 100% branch and
statement coverage have been achieved. Any variations are small, which means our code is being tested successfully.
