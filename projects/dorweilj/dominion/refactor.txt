- Refactor of dominion.c 

- Minion Card

Added a minion_refact function that is called in the minion card switch in the cardEffect function.  Changed the conditional that checks if state->handCount < 4.  Instead of checking the conditional it will instead apply a left bit shift to handCount[i].

- Smithy Card

Added smithy_refact function that is called in the smithy card switch in the cardEffect function.  Changed it to check that "i" is <= 3.  So it will draw 4 cards now

- Adventurer 

Added adventurer_refact function that is called in the adventurer card switch in the cardEffect function.  I changed the logic of the conditional that checks if a treasure card has been drawn.  I removed gold cards from the conditional.  This means that only coppers and silvers are counted as treasure cards.

- Village

Added village_refact function that is called in the village card switch in the cardEffect function.  I changed it so that instead of adding 2 actions it removes two actions. 

- Outpost

Added outpost_refact function that is called in the outpost card switch in the cardEffect function.  I added a call to drawCard that will add a card to the player's hand.
