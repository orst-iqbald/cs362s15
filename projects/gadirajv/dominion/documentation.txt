Dominion Card Game – This is a documentation of smithy and adventurer cards, as well as of the discardCard() and updateCoins() methods. 
Smithy Card:
The smithy card allows the player to draw three cards by calling drawCard() three times. Then a card from the hand is discarded by calling discardCard(). To purchase a smithy card a player needs 4 coins. 
Adventurer Card:
The adventurer card allows a player to reveal cards from their deck until they reveal 2 Treasure cards by calling the drawCard() function inside of a while condition that runs until 2 treasure cards are revealed. If the deck runs out (is empty), then the discard pile is shuffled and added to the deck.
For every card that is drawn in this while loop, if the card drawn is a Treasure Card, then the number of Treasure Cards drawn is iterated by 1 (int drawnTreasure keeps track of the number of Treasure Cards). If the card drawn is not a Treasure Card, then the card is added to an array of cards called “temphand”. After two Treasure cards are drawn, meeting the while condition, all the non-Treasure cards that were drawn during this action and stored in array “temphand” are discarded.
discardCard() 
discardCard() removes a card from the player’s hand. First it validates the card being played can be played and then calls cardEffect to play the card. Inputs are state (state of the Game), handPos, currentPlayer, and trashFlag. Unless either the last card in the hand array is played or there is only one card in the hand, the discarded card is replaced with the last card in the hand and the last card is set to -1. For all instances, the number of cards in the hand is decremented. 
updateCoins():
updateCoins returns the count of a specific card in a specific player’s discard deck and hand. Each time updateCoins is called, the coin count is reset. The method uses a for loop to add coins for each Treasure Card in the player’s hand. After that any bonuses are added.
