Cards

- Smithy Card

Draw three more cards. Discard the smithy card.

The code runs a loop three times calling drawCard() method on each iteration. 
After that it calls discardCard() once to remove the smithy card.
	
- Adventurer Card

DrawnTreasure is initialized to zero at the top of cardEffect method.  While the drawntreasure
value is less than two keep drawing cards.  If the deck it empty then re-shuffle then draw
a card.  If the card drawn is a copper, silver, or gold then increment the drawntreasure value.
If the card drawn is not copper, silver, or gold then add the drawn card to the tempHand array.


Methods

 - discardCard()
 Args: hand position (int), currentPlayer (int), gameState (struct prt), trashFlag (int)

 First check to see if the current card is to be trashed.  If so then add it to the played
 card pile.  Increment the played card count.
 If the player has a card in their hand set handPos to play it.  If it's the players last
 card then decrement handCount.  If the player has more than one card left discard the current
 one and decrement the last card.  Decrement the player's handCount.   

 - updateCoins()

 Args: player (int), state (gameState prt), bonus (int)

 Initialize coins to zero.  For each of the treasure cards in a players hand
 add +1 for copper, +2 for silver, +3 for gold.  Then add an additional 
 bonus number if given.
