Bugs found in the unit and card tests for assignment 3:

Unittest1 – discardCard()
	The specifications for the constraints on the parameters are not clear:  
	Does discardCard require handPos < handCount and handCount > 0?  It is possible that the below two failures are violations of preconditions and should be handled by the calling function.
	Bugs found:
	1. It fails if you try to discard (or trash) from an empty hand.
	2. It fails if you try to discard from a hand position (handPos) that is >= to the handCount.

Unittest2 – scoreFor()
	Bugs found:
	1. Gardens are not calculated correctly (they are always 0).
	2. The hand and discard piles are fine, but the deck is not gone through properly: it seems that the discardCount is being used, so if the discardCount >= to the deckCount it is scored correctly, otherwise  the cards in the deck are not scored.

Unittest3 - endTurn()
	A couple specifications are not clear:
	Is endTurn() responsible for doing something if an Outpost was played or does that happen somewhere else?
	Shouldn’t endTurn() draw for the player whose turn just ended?  Otherwise how is something like Cutpurse to work?!
	Bugs found:
	1. Not all cards are discarded correctly when playedCardCount is greater than 0.
	2. A new hand of 5 cards is not draw for the player whose turn just ended.

Unittest4 - updateCoins()
	The specifications are not clear: is the bonus an additional bonus or the total of all bonuses?
	If it is supposed to be the total bonuses, than the following bug may not be the fault of updateCoins(). 
	Bugs found:
	1. When a coin bonus already exists, calling updateCoins() again messes up the coin count (both when it is adding a new bonus and when the "new bonus" is 0)
	
Cardtest1 - Smithy
	Bugs found:
	1. The number of cards played is always wrong (this is the bug I introduced in refactor.txt)
	
Cardtest2 - Adventurer
	Bugs found:
	1. There is a segmentation fault if both the deck and the discard have zero cards.
	2. If something other than a treasure (an estate) is bypassed, the deck+discard count is incorrect. (This is likely the bug I introduced in refactor.txt)
	3. Even if the first two cards drawn are treasures, the played card count is incorrect.
	
Cardtest3 - Cutpurse
	Bugs found:
	1. If another player has a copper, it fails to be placed in their discard pile correctly.
		
Cardtest4 - Sea Hag
	Bugs found:
	1. The top card of the other player's deck does not have a curse.  When I tried a few follow up tests, it appear that the other player's deckCount is also wrong, and possibly one or more cards in the deck is wrong.
