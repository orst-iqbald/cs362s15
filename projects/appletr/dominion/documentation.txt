The smithy card can be played during the action phase of a player. The player then draws 3 cards from their deck. 
If their deck no longer has three cards, they can draw as many cards as possible before shuffling their discard pile and
drawing their remaining cards from the new deck. The smithy card can be bought during the player's buy phase, during which it 
costs 4.

The adventurer card can be played during the action phase of a player. The player then draws cards from their deck until they find two 
treasure cards. If their deck no longer has two treasure cards in it, they can draw as many cards as possible before shuffling their
discard pile and drawing from the new deck. The adventurer card can be bought during the player's buy phase, during which it costs 6. 

The updateCoins function in dominion.c updates the number of coins that a player can use during their buy phase. First, it checks
every card in the player's hand, adding 1 when it finds a copper, two when it finds a silver, and three when it finds a gold. It also
can add a bonus to the number of coins available for purchasing. The bonus can be tracked through the action phase of the player, 
adding coins as a result of action cards. 

The discardCard function discards a particular card in the player's hand. It also has an option to trash the card, which means it will
not enter the discard or played card array. It also sets the value of the hand position to -1, which means it is no longer available to be played.
It also handles the logic for moving up the card in the hand by replacing the discarded card with the "last" card, that is the card in the highest
position.
