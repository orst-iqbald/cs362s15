UNIT TEST 1: Discard Card

This function is broken in two ways:

1. It tries to use a temporary array called playedCards to store cards that have been
discarded but are not supposed to be trashed. This violates the rules of Dominion which
state that when a card is discarded it should immediately be put into the discard pile,
so that it is susceptible to being reshuffled back into the deck and may possibly be
drawn again.

2. Cards that enter the playedCards array never make it into the discard pile. They are
lost after the player's turn has ended. This is a serious issue. When a turn is ended,
the player's hand is discarded manually, without making use of this function. It appears
that only cards discarded by ending a turn ever make it into the discard pile.

This function does handle trashing correctly. Cards that are processed with the trash flag
set are successfully removed from the player's hand and removed from the game entirely.
