Most of the Bugs that I did find were do to my own doing in assignment 2. Some critical bugs were found in test card #4, #3, and #2 but for the most part they were already recognized. Test #4 tested the mind card and rather than increasing the individuals treasures the card seemed diminished players treasures based upon certain inputs but i didn’t dig in deep enough to find the exact cases I just determined that it was clearly outputting at times an incorrect value. in test #3 I looked at the Sea Hag card. It seemed to give every player a curse card as oppose to my original thought of the cards being used to give opponents a curse. In card test #2 the adventure card gave away one too many cards from the deck and added one too many coins to the players hand. After writing all of there unit test I can really see the advantage of randomized test because I was only able to do so much, I mean yes there was more information that I could of potentially tested for but I feel as if one could just get a deeper test of the system with random test, many of my unit test just barely scratched the surface, and not to mention I feel randomize test creation would of been a lot more engaging and felt more coding like. . I didn’t seem to get too many if any unit test failures or if I did I was not able to find them because to me they logically made sense. I think if your sitting in front of the computer for 12 plus hours straight you can really  make some mistakes and depending on what your working on that could be the difference between life and death. Over all I wish I would of implemented randomized test, I would of felt more confident in my end product, and I would of actually enjoyed the assignment.
