Bugs!
=====
I found a number of bugs in the dominion.c program while doing my unitTests. I
mainly found the tests when doing the card tests. One of the main things was
that the adventure call to discard card would fail for some reason with a
segfault. I am not sure why this happens it seemed a few things were out of
bounds, but I can't remember what. I tried to get it to execute but however I
was unable. That is why there are no tests for the adventure card.


Another bug I found was in the councilRoomEffect. The council room is supposed
to add on another buy, but however it set the number of buys to zero. I have
since fixed this.
