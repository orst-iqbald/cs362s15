Assignment 3

In an effort to make my unit tests and card tests universal, meaning they could be used with anyone’s 
refactored dominion code, I essentially shot myself in the foot. When the playCard or cardEffect functions
are called the code does not want to select the right case from cardEffect. Essentially the card is played
but does nothing. For example, if I set the handCount to 1 and set the card at the first hand position to 
smithy, when I call the playCard function, which should lead to the card being introduced into cardEffect()
and its effect then performed, the program performs as if no card were played.  

When I attempted to change the code to focus only on some of my refactored functions from assignment 2
however, the code was able to pick up my introduced bugs. From what I gathered from the assignment and
the posts on Piazza however, the code was just supposed to work with dominion.c, not our versions. This
left me with some code that wasn’t working properly and I see this as a major bug.
