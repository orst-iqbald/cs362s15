/***Adventurer***/
Moved adventurer to its own function doAdventurer. Passed all necessary args from cardEffect into function call.
Added test checks for all funcs that expect a return value.
Bug: Added free/null of state and tempHand. Memory may be dereferenced later without checks for null.
Bug: Modified count on temp hand clean up from [z-1] to z. z-1 was the correct value for the while and temphand.

/***Smithy***/
Moved smithy to its own function doSmithy. Passed all necessary args from cardEffect into function call.
Bug: Changed for loop to terminate i <= 3 instead of i < 3.
Bug: Added free/null of state and tempHand. Memory may be dereferenced later without checks for null.
Bug: Added handpos-- instead of handpos, should change position of discard selection.

/***Village***/
Moved village to its own function doVillage. Passed all necessary args from cardEffect into function call.
Bug: Discard handpos -1 instead of handpos, should change position of discard selection
Bug: Added free/null of state. Memory may be dereferenced later without checks for null.
Bug: Did currentPlayer++ in drawCard call. Should result in discard from currentPlayer + 1 in discardCard call.

/***Treasure_Map**/
Moved treasure_map to its own function doTreasureMap. Passed all necessary args from cardEffect into function call, expect index. Got rid of it.
Bug: Did index+= i instead of index = i.
Bug: Returns 1 on success, -1 on failure, but check statement in cardEffect assumes 0 is success. So -1 gets returned from cardEffect to playCard.

/***Steward***/
Moved steward case to its own function doSteward. Passed all necessary args from cardEffect into function call. 
Made int array of choices to pass into function to cut down on param list size.
