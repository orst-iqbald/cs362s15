Quiz 2

To get the value for 'c', I generated a random number between 26 and 100. That made
it advance to stage 9 in a fraction of a second. To generate the input string, I 
randomly generated 5 lowercase letters and then returned it. There is only a 1 out of
a 11,881,376 chance that the string will be the correct one, so it took some time to 
trigger the error. After nearly 22,000,000 iterations, it caught the error. This took 
almost 26 minutes, but it was accomplished.
