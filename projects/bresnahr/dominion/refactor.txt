In dominion.c I added the following funcitons:
newSmithy(int currentPLayer, struct gameState *state, int handPos)
newAdventurer(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state)
newRemodel(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int handPos, int choice1, int choice2)
newCouncil_room(int currentPlayer, stuct gameState *struct, int handPos)
newSea_hag(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state)

In the cardEffect function I added an int getNew and initialized it to 0.  This variable is used for the return value of these new functions.
For each new function, in the dominion.c code, I commented out the code where their respective switch statements were and added
a call to the new function.  The getNew variable is set to the value of the new function and the value is returned within that switch statement.


newSmithy()
This function draws 3 cards to the current player and discards the smithy card.
A bug was added to the for loop that calls drawCard.  I changed the "less than 3" to "less than or equl to 3", therefore
it iterates 4 times instead of 3.
for(i = 0; i <= 3; i++)

newAdventurer()
The adventurer card reveals cards from the players deck until 2 treasure cards are found- they are put into their hand and
the other revealed cards are discarded.  If the deck is empty the shuffle is called.
I placed a bug during the process of checking if the drawn card is a treasure card.
If it is a gold card it will not be considered a treasure card.  I did this by changing the if statement:
if (cardDrawn == copper || cardDrawn == silver || cardDrawn == gold)
I changed the 'cardDrawn == gold' to 'cardDrawn != gold'.
Also I placed an unnecessary call to shuffle outside of the if statement that checks and calls shuffle if the deck is empty.

newRemodel()
Remodel trashes a card allowing you to gain a gain worth 2 more than the trashed card.
Instead of gaining a card the player chooses worth 2 more, a bug adds the card that was supposed to be trashed to the player's hand.
gainCard(choice2, state, 0, currentPlayer) was changed to gainCard(choice1, state, 0, currentPlayer)
Also the code that checks if the card the player wants to trash is in the hand, I added a condition that it will trash the current card
being checked if it is a smithy card.
'if( state->hand[currentPlayer][i] == j )' was changed to 'if( state->hand[currentPlayer][i] == j || state->hand[currentPlayer][i] == smithy)'

newCouncil_room()
Council room adds 4 cards to the current player's hand and allows an extra buy.  Each other players draw a card.
A bug exists when the other players draw a card.  Instead of only having the other players add a card, each player will add a card.
'if( i != currentPlayer )' was changed to 'if( i == currentPlayer )'

newSea_hag()
Each other player discard the top card of their deck and gains a curse card.  Tis is placed on the top of the deck.
I added the benefit the player that played the sea hag card will also gain 3 gold.
updateCoins(currentPlayer, state, 3);
