In the unittest1.txt updateCoins I found that if the last card is either copper, silver, or gold and there are four players there is a failure
the g.coins != the coinSum as it should.

For the unittest2.txt shuffle test there is an occasional variance in the quantity of each card when the deck gets shuffled, so when the
player shuffles his cards there will be different amounts of a certain card pre and post shuffle.

For unittest3.txt the endTurn function I was not able to get the turn to end correctly with 3 players in the game.

For unittest4.txt the discardCard function I did not find any odd bugs in the function.
