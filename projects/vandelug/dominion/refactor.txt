cards refactored:
Adventurer -> playAdventurer() with bug injection
Smithy     -> playSmithy() with bug injection
Village    -> playVillage() with bug injection
GreatHall  -> playGreatHall() with bug injection
Feast      -> playFeast() clean

Injected bugs:

playAdventurer() - ln 1260 increment numActions, nothing crazy just an increment

playSmith() - ln 1282 switches the value of numBuys and coins prior to drawing cards to make numBuys = 0 sometimes

playGreatHall() - ln 1360,1362 currentPlayer and nextPlayer both draw one card

playVillage() - ln 1351-1354 if numActions is more than three, numBuys is incremented by 1 and coins is incremented by 2
