Smithy: 
	When the Smithy card is played, the player draws 3 cards. This is achieved by looping through the drawCard() function 3 times. 
	The smithy card is then discarded from the hand.
 
Adventurer: 
	The Adventurer card cycles through the player's deck until 2 treasure cards, those 2 treasure cards are added to your hand and the rest are discarded. 
	This achieved using a while loop that runs until 2 treasure cards are drawn. 
	If the deck is empty, shuffle the discard pile and add back to the deck. 
	You then draw a card, if it’s a treasure card, add 1 to drawntreasure, else it goes back to the beginning of the loop. 
	Once 2 treasure cards have been drawn and the loop ends, all non-treasure cards that have been drawn are discarded. 

DiscardCard(): 
	This function discards the card. If the trashedFlag is set to 1, then the card is trashed (removed from play). 
	If it’s not set to 1, then it is added to the played pile. 
	The card that the player has just played is then set to -1, showing it’s a discarded card. 
	If the last card from the player's hand is 
	played, or the player only has one card left in their hand, the number of cards in their hand is decremented by 1. 
	Else, the discarded card replaces the last card in the player's hand, the last card is set to -1, and the number of cards in the player's hand is decremented by 1. 

updateCoins(): 
	This function adds coins to the player depending on what card is played. 
	The initial count is set to 0, then a for-loop runs counting each treasure card in the player’s hand. 
	1, 2 or 3 coins are added depending on if a Copper, Silver or Gold card exist. 
	Any bonus coins that were passed in through the bonus variable, 
	which would have been received through the action phased through certain action cards, 
	are then added to the total number of coins the player has access to for that turn.
