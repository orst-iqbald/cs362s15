The error message is found or triggered, after the returned inputChars have placed the
program into state 9 and while in state 9, the returned inputString is equal to the string/word "reset"

The following creates a random tester that has a rather low chance to trigger the end condition
when in state 9, string = "reset"

Anyway:

inputChar()
	randomly return one of printable characters having ascii code, x
	such that      32 <= x <= 126

inputString()
	setup a char array of size 6 (to account for 5 chars plus 1 null terminator)
	set all chars in array to '\0'
	
	randomly get a number from 1 to 5 inclusive and assign to string_length
	in a for loop up to string_length, populate members of char array by calling inputChar()
	
	malloc the return string, copying contents of char array to return string
	and then return the return string.
