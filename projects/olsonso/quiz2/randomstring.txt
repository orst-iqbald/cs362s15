This purpose of this testme.c is to be a test file that creates a random test to cause an error message to be printed when executed. 

I used the input charcters that I came up with to randomize. I chose 6,  'a', 'b', '(', ')', 'c', 'z' to be evaluated and randomly select one of the chosen characters to be returned. 

For the next function I used a different array of charcters, 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g'. This second function checks the positions form 0 to 4 with the memory lenght 5. Once the memory space is made then it goes through and puts a random charcter in the given array that was created.
