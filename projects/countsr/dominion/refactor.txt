Code Refactoring

5 cards were moved to functions: adventurer, smithy, remodel, minion and steward. The function headers were placed in the dominion_helpers.h file. The methods are called in the appropriate place in the switch statement in dominion.c.


smithy()
No cards are drawn when this is played. The ‘i < 3’ was changed to ‘i > 3’ so the loop exits immediately.

adventurer()
When a non-treasure card is drawn the ‘drawntreasure’ variable is incremented which means the player could potentially not draw all of the treasure cards they are allowed.

steward() 
If a player chooses to trash a card the card gets discarded and put back into the played pile instead of trashed from the game. This was accomplished by changing the 4th argument of the else statement to 0 instead of 1.

minion()
When the add 2 coins option is selected the coins aren’t added because the assignment operator ‘=‘ is changed to a comparison operator ‘==‘.
