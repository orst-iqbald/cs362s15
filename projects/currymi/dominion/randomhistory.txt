Random History

Random Card Test - Smithy
========================
The smithy card test went well. To Check for the correct input validation I
made a load of print statements to print out the values of the state that I was
randomizing to ensure that they were in the realms of realism and not off on
some strange no possible land. No bugs were found. I also made sure to look
inside the gcov file to make sure that every part of the function was being
called at least once.


Random Card Test - Adventurer
=============================
I did same thing for the adventure test as that I did with the smithy test
above ( print statments & expecting the gcov output). However the adventure
fails during a call to draw or discard call with a bus error! More of what is
causing this problem needs to be examined!
