Below are the 5 cards that I pulled out of the switch statement and created individual functions for.
For all of them, either the bug introduced into the code is described, or it is stated that no bug
has been introduced and the card's behavior remains unchanged.

1. Adventurer
The Adventurer looks through the deck until it finds two treasure cards. All cards that are drawn that
are NOT treasure cards are discarded. I left this mostly unchanged, but I have caused it to fail to
recognize Silver as a treasure card. This was accomplished simply by removing the silver check from
the conditional. Thus the Adventurer will continue drawing past a silver and only register coppers
and golds as treasure cards. Any silvers that are drawn will be discarded.

2. Smithy
The Smithy is a simple card that lets the player draw 3 additional cards. Rather than tinker with that
behavior, I used the updateCoins function to decrease player's total coins by one.

UPDATE: My bug failed to actually negatively impact the program. It turns out that updateCoins is called again after my bugged call to it, which erases the negative effect of my bugged call.

3. Village
The village is a card that replaces itself by allowing you to draw another card and gives you two actions,
leaving you with a 5 card hand and one 'bonus' action. I tweaked this card to give you an extra card instead
of merely replacing itself.

4. Council Room
I left the draw 4 cards functionality intact, and I did not change the behavior where all other players
get to draw one extra card whenever this is played. I removed the bonus buy from this card, though.

5. Great Hall
The great hall was moved to its own function but its behavior was unaffected.
