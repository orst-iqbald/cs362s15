/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * unittest1 : buyCard() function
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------*/
 Lines executed: 21.73% of 566 from 'dominion.c'

 Every line that was not a debug print statement was covered by my unit testing.
 This unit test has 100% branch and statement coverage inside the buycard()
 function.

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * unittest2 : initializeGame() function
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------*/
 Lines executed: 17.49% of 566 from 'dominion.c'

 Almost every line was covered by my unit testing.
 This unit test has 98% branch and statement coverage inside the initializeGame()
 function. This is extremely thorough coverage, and only fails to test the branch
 where initializeGame() checks for the failure of another game function(shuffle())

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * unittest3 : shuffle() function
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------*/
 Lines executed: 16.08% of 566 from 'dominion.c'

 Every line was covered by my unit testing.
 This unit test has 100% branch and statement coverage inside the shuffle()
 function.

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * unittest4 : endTurn() function
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------*/
 Lines executed: 19.79% of 566 from 'dominion.c'

 Every line was covered by my unit testing.
 This unit test has 100% branch and statement coverage inside the endTurn()
 function. 

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * cardtest1 : effectSmithy() function
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------*/
 Lines executed: 17.14% of 566 from 'dominion.c'

 Every line was covered by my unit testing.
 This unit test has 100% branch and statement coverage inside the 
 effectSmithy() function.

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * cardtest2 : effectAdventurer() function
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------*/
 Lines executed: 24.38% of 566 from 'dominion.c'

 Every line was covered by my unit testing.
 This unit test has 100% branch and statement coverage inside the 
 effectAdventurer() function.

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * cardtest3 : effectCouncilRoom() function
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------*/
 Lines executed: 19.79% of 566 from 'dominion.c'

 Every line was covered by my unit testing.
 This unit test has 100% branch and statement coverage inside the 
 effectCouncilRoom() function.

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * cardtest4 : effectCutpurse() function
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------*/
 Lines executed: 19.79% of 566 from 'dominion.c'

 The coverage for this unit test is rather bad. However the fault lies in
 the effectCutpurse() function rather than the unit test. There are several
 branches of the effectCutpurse() function that are entirely unreachable,
 and an indexing error (described in refactor.txt) is causing another branch
 to fail even with proper testing input.

 This unit test has 56% statement coverage and 50% branch coverage
 inside the effectCutpurse() function.
