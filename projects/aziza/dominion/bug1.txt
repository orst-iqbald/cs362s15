unittest4: supplyCount function
	However, the bug I found I believe is in the initalize function. Looking at the code, the "feast" card looks like it should be initalized with 10 cards in its pile. However, when running the init and checking, it only has 8. 

Since my card tests were done on the cards that I introduced bugs on, many of the bugs below are from those bugs that I introduced.
cardtest1: Smithy Card
	It was adding 4 cards to the hand because of the bug I introduced. 
cardtest4: Outpost Card
	Correctly removing a card, however wasn't incremeneting the outpost played count (because of the bug I introduced). 


What was more interesting, was that many of the bugs I introduced (for example, not initializing the variables to 0) actually didn't have as big of an effect on my testing. What that means is either:
1. Not a bug, and will run properly. 
2. My testing isn't thorough enough to hit the error. Something I should look into more.
