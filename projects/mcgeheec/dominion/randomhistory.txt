Random Testing Dominion

For the first test, I created a random test for the adventurer card. I did this
by implementing a full game. The game randomly plays an action card if one is
in the hand, randomly buys a card if there is enough money and a card left to
buy, ends the turn, and ends the game once the game should be over. Every time
an adventurer card is played, the results are checked such as the number of 
treasure cards in hand and the number of cards in the deck and discard.

This test revealed at least one bug in the program. I made a quick calculation
to determine how many games I should have the tester play to finish testing in 
three hours. However my calculation was way off so I had to stop the tester after
it had run for 7 hours. In that time, it failed 25,000 tests. Because I had to end
it prematurely, I was not able to get coverage information.

The second card that I tested was the treasure map card. I again used a full game
implementation for the tester. This test also revealed bugs. After running for 4 hours,
about 1.8 million tests failed. I also was unable to get coverage information for this
tester.
