Documentation of smithy, adventure cards and discardCard() and updateCoins() methods.

Smithy Card:

The smithy card allows a player to draw 3 cards by calling drawCard() 3 times on the current player.
A for loop is used to call drawCard on the currentPlayer and state dependencies.
After drawing 3 cards the discardCard() method is called to discard a card from the hand.

The Adventure card reveals cards in the player's deck until 2 Treasure cards are revealed.  They are put into the player's hand and the other revealed cards are discarded.
If the deck is empyt (state->deckCount[currentPlayer] < 1), shuffle(currentPlayer, state) is called.
A card is drawn and it is set to the top of the hand.
int drawnTreasure keeps count of the drawn treasure cards.  This is checked by comparing the drawn card to the cards: coppers, silver and gold.
While it is less than 2, drawCard() is called.  If the deck is empty shuffle discard and add to deck.
If the card drawn (cardDrawn) is copper, silver or gold, drawnTreasure's count increases by 1.
A temporary hand is created and each drawn card that is not a treasure card is added to this stack and the top card in the player deck is decreased (or removed from the top).
Afterward, the amount of drawn cards in the temporary hand are discarded from the current player's state. 

DiscardCard() effectively removes a card from the player's hand.
Inputs are handPos, currentPlayer, gameState and trashFlag.  If the card is not trashed (trashFlag < 1) it is added into the played pile.
The method checks if the card is the last card played in the hand array (handPos == (state->handCount[cuurentPlayer] - 1) or
if there is only one card in the hand (state->handCount[currentPlayer] == 1). 
If there is more than 1 card in the hand the discarded card is replaced by the last card in the hand and it is set to -1.
For all circumstances, the number of cards in hands is decreased by 1, removing the card from the player's hand.

UpdateCoins() method returns the count of a specific card in a player's discard deck and hand.
Inputs are player, gameState and bonus.
The coin count is reset to 0 and for each card in the players hand it checks if the card is copper, silver or gold and increases the coin count respectively.
This final amount is added to the bonus input.
