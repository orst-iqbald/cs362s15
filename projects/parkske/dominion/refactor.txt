/***Adventurer***/
Moved adventurer to its own function doAdventurer. Passed all necessary args from cardEffect into function call.
Added test checks for all funcs that expect a return value.
Bug: Added free/null of state and tempHand. Memory may be dereferenced later without checks for null.
Bug: Modified count on temp hand clean up from [z-1] to z. z-1 was the correct value for the while and temphand.

/***Smithy***/
Moved smithy to its own function doSmithy. Passed all necessary args from cardEffect into function call.
Bug: Changed for loop to terminate i <= 3 instead of i < 3.
Bug: Added free/null of state and tempHand. Memory may be dereferenced later without checks for null.
Bug: Added handpos-- instead of handpos, should change position of discard selection.
