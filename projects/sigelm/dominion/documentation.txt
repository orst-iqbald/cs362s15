Smithy card:
The smithy care increases you handsize by 3 cards when played. The cost to purchase this card is 4 coins (gold, silver, copper, whatever combination equal to 4). This card is also a kingdom card and is specifically an action card.

Adventurer card:
This card is also an action card like the Smithy card, but is instead an adventurer card versus a kingdom card. This card allows you to search through your deck until you find 2 treasure cards to be placed in your hand. All other cards are discarded, and this card costs 6 coins.

discardCard() function:
This function remoces cards from a player as they are played in a round. The card is checked for if it has trashFlag to determine if it is placed into the discard pile or not. Then, the number of cards available to play during this turn is decremented. After that the card is located from within a players hand and is removed. Then, the number of cards in your hand is reduced.

updateCoins() function:
This function updates current total number of coins available to a player when they play their treasure cards. At first the total coin count is reset, then the players hand is checked for copper, silver, and gold coins and the value of these is added to the coin count for the current players game state. Then, bonus coins are included from other cards that can provide coins.
