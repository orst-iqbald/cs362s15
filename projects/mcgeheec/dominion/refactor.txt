These are the cards that I implemented in their own function and the names of the functions:
	adventurer => playAdventurer()
	cutpurse => playCutPurse()
	feast => playFeast()
	remodel => playRemodel()	
	smithy => playSmithy()
	
These are the bugs I introduced into these functions:
	playAdventurer(): Instead of reshuffling the deck when it reaches zero cards, it only reshuffles when the deck
	reaches -1 cards.
	playCutPurse(): I switched the arguments passed to discardCard() so that now the wrong player discards the wrong
	card. 
	playRemodel(): Instead of gaining the desired card, the player gains the card they just trashed.	
	playSmithy(): Instead of drawing three cards and discarding one, it now discards three and draws one.
