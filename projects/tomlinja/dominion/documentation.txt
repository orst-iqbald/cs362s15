smithy:

The smithy draws three cards for the player. The smithy card is then
discarded.


adventurer:

The adventurer card draws cards from the deck (reshuffling the deck if
necessary) until two treasure cards are drawn. If a treasure card is drawn it
goes into the player's hand. If the card drawn is not a treasure card it is
removed from the player's hand and placed in a temporary deck. Once two
treasure cards have been drawn, the temporary deck is discarded back into the
discard pile.


discardCard():

discardCard() adds the card to the played pile if the card has not been
trashed. It then removes the card from the player's hand, replacing it with
the last card in the player's hand.


updateCoins():

updateCoins() calculates the total number of coins the player has available in
his hand. Each treasure card is worth 1, 2, or 3 coins. A bonus number of
coins can be added to the total if provided.
