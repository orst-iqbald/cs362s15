Compile: gcc -o testme testme.c
Run: testme

For this tester, it needed to pass two conditional statements in the testme() function. 
One of nine specific ASCII characters had to be generated, 
and then a specifc string had to be in a correct order. 
These two conditions were found via two functions that we had to implement.

inputChar(): For the first funcution inputChar(), 
I wanted a semi-broad range of characters to choose from, so I encompassed the entire range
between the first character and last character, numerically, in the ASCII table, 
which happened to be between 32-125. So for this function, a
random number is generated between 0-93, then 32 is added to it to get our random character 
to be returned to the testme() function.

intputString(): This function returns a five character string to testme(). 
So then, I created an array of characters that contained each of the 
four available characters in the needed string, 'r', 'e', 's' and 't'. 
The function then creates the string to hold it, and runs a for loop to fill
the array, and in the loop it randomly selects a position from the array holding 
the characters and inserts it into the current position in the string.
It then returns the finished string to the testme() function.

The loop in the testme() function would then run until all the conditions were met. 
In the number of times that I ran it, it averaged probably 
somewhere between 1600-1800 iterations, though I had it complete the quickest around 800, 
and at most around 5200 iterations.
