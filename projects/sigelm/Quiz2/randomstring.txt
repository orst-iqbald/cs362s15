 The object of this testme.c file was to create a random test that would cause the error message to be printed out.
 Before starting I read through the code to make sure I understood what the code would do so I could get a better understanding
 of what it was I needed to do. We are only evaluating a small set of characters in the control statements, so we
 could decide that we should only generate random characters from that subset.
 
 The input characters were only evaluated ahainst this subset of characters: 
 ('[', '(', '{', ' ', 'a', 'x', '}', ')', ']').
 In the inputChar() function our goal was to randomly select one of those characters to be returned.
 
 The input string was an array of characters where the testMe() function only evalauated whether the following set of characters 
 occured in a particular sequence:
 ('r', 'e', 's', 't', '\0').
 The function checks positions 0-5, so in the inputString() function we allocate memory for a string of length 6.
 Then we populate each position with a randomly selected character from the set of the characters listed above.
 
 After running the program multiple times we see that it quickly and successfully halts after printing the error message.
 Once testMe() function enters the while loop it will not exit without printing the error message. Each iteration calls inputChar()
 and inputString() which will then generate new random input each time. The input character is evaluated and as the appropriate
 character is discoverd during the appropriate state, then the string is evaluated. when the characters of the string appear in the order
 "reset\0" and the level is 9, the error message is printed.
