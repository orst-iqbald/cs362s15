Assignment 4 - Random Testing

----------------
Testing the Adventurer Card (playAdventurer function):

In designing this random test I drew on the lectures on random testing.
I knew I would want a loop that could be easily adjusted to run any number of times.
I also knew I would create a gameState, make a backup, then run the adventurer
function on it. This would let me easily compare the two for any changed
variables that should not have been, or the reverse.

The adventurer card draws cards until it finds two treasure cards, then it
discards the adventurer card and any additional cards it drew, and puts the
treasure in the player's hand.

I will describe the tests and their results on my 10,000 loop run below.

#Test1
The first test I ran simply checks if the function returns 0 as it should.
This passed every time.

#Test2
This tested whether the handCount reflects additional cards added
This failed every time. This is due to the bug I introduced, so it was expected.

#Test3
This tested that two treasure cards were drawn and made sure they were, in fact,
treasure cards.
This failed every time. This is due to the bug I introduced in assignment 2, so it
was expected.

#Test4
This tested the discards to make sure the function did discard.
This test passed every time.

#Test5
This tested that numActions was NOT decreased after playing the card.
This passed every time, as numActions is decreased by the playCard function (which
eventually calls playAdventurer) and not specifically in playAdventurer, which is
what is being tested here.

#Remaining Tests
The remaining tests all check the other gameState variables to make sure they were
NOT changed, as they should all be the same at this point.
These tests all passed every time.

Coverage:
My results for coverage were as follows:

Function 'playAdventurer'
Lines executed:83.33% of 18
Branches executed:100.00% of 12
Taken at least once:66.67% of 12
No calls

I believe the reason that not 100% of the lines were executed is due to the bug
introduced back in assignment 2. I chose to make it so that it will never draw
the right number of treasure cards, and this changes the rest of the function
behavior as some parts, such as the discard, won't be called in certain cases when
this happens. As such, I believe my random tester is functional as is.

----------------
Testing the Outpost Card (playOutpost function):

I chose to test this function since it was the function that I did NOT add a bug
to in assignment 2. This way, I can test it fully without having to think which
reported failures might have been introduced via the intentional bugs in the function.
