unittest1.c 
	lines executed: 100 of 57
	branches executed: 100% of 28
	
	updateCoins() is executed 99 times: After setting the initial hand with copper silver and gold cards.
	Both the assert branch for check number of coins, and handCount were one sided. For the most part, the if statement 
	shows for both that branch 1 and 3 are executed 100% of the time whereas branch 2 was not executed. Although, this matter is 
	trivial because we are really concerned with whether the function has failed or not.
	bonus was not checked or asserted
	
	The number of times to test the function updateCoins() could be increased to check for the robustness of the function. This would
	test whether the system breaks with large amount of data. This is one way to improve this test.

unittest2.c 
	lines executed: 91.67% of 24
	branches executed: 100% of 12
	
	getCost() was run 1027 times. 27 times covered each card's cost. 1001 times covered calls to random cards.
	getCost() was run 99 times with false card numbers. Each time 
		The fail branch from the if statement never executed  because there was no bugs found. 
	

unittest3.c 
	lines executed: 98.43% of 127
	branches executed: 100.00% of 42
	the fullDeckCount function is executed around 29 times
		2 for upper and lower boundaries
		27 for random card input
	
	The overall statement coverage is comprehensive. 
	Each for-loop is executed the proper amount of times and verifies the correct output.
	
	The branch coverage is very detailed in the switch statement indicates
	cards have been added to the deck, hand, and discard piles. This reveals how the switch statement was working and that
	there is not a similar count in the fullDeckCount function.
	Branch 27 was taken 0%: this means one of the boundary branches were not covered.
	
unittest4.ca
	lines executed: 96.30% of 27
	branches executed: 100% of 20
	
	isGameOver() is run 1100 times. The first 100 times the branches determine whether the game has ended based on the number of province cards.
	Once province cards == 0, the game ends, and it ends indeed.
		-When the function is called within a for loop that iterates 100 times, the output is consistent. On the other hand,
		when the for-loop runs 1000 times, isGameOver() fails the test, and the oracle prints the fail statement. This reveals that
		of isGameOver() is not a robust function, and breaks. Or this reveals a possible bug in the function.
