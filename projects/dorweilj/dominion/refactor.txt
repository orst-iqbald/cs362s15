- Refactor of dominion.c 

- Minion Card

Added a minion_refact function that is called in the minion card switch.  Changed the conditional that checks if state->handCount < 4.  Instad of checking the conditional it will instead apply a left bit shift to handCount[i].

- Smithy Card

Added smithy_refact function that is called in the smithy card switch.  Changed it to check that "i" is <= 3.  So it will draw 4 cards now

- Adventurer 

Added adventurer_refact function that is called in the adventurer card switch.  I changed the logic of the conditional that checks if a treasure card has been drawn.  I changed it from || to &&.  This means that only coppers are counted as being treasure cards.
