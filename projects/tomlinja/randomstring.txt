The assignment instructions did not specify what domain the random values
  should come from, so I used my own as follows:

For inputChar() the character is chosen randomly from '[', '(', '{', ' ', 'a',
  'x', '}', ')', ']'

For inputString() the string is chosen randomly from "open", "close", "reset",
  "start", "end", "shutdown"

The random testing is guided because only a narrow range of values is
randomly tested. The testing can be expanded to include other values, but this
will reduce the probability of hitting the error message.
