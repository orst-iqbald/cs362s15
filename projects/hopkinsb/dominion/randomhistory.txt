Writing my programs did not prove to be very difficult, however I've ended up with some very strange errors in my code. 
Although, randomtestadventurer and randomtestcard have essentially the same code, and I am able to run randomtestcard without
error, when I try to run randomtestadventure I repeatedly get a "bus error" message from the compiler. By using trace statements
I found that this error occurs before my call to the function in dominion.c but I can't find where that kind of error would be
happening. Another strange thing is that trying to run immediately after the makefile produces a seg fault but all other times 
produce this bus error.

Another problem I faced was copying to my makefile. Although randomtestcard can be run via the executable an without error, 
copying its results gets a memory error. I looked at the makefiles of other students and mine looked similar, if not identical
to other's approaches so I am confused. I was able to get the makefile to print to randomtestcard.out once, but not since.

From what I was able to see from that one successful writing however was that my random testing did increase coverage as compared
to my unit testing. I was able to more thoroughly cover the code and I belive this was due to the amount of testing I was able
to quickly perform with this type of testing.

Overall, I like the idea of random testing. I think that being able to repeatedly test the code using acceptable inputs is a good 
way to find bugs. I actually found some errors that I had not previously noted in my dominion.c code by using this random method.
