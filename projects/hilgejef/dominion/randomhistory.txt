Randomly testing of Adventurer
to run: make randomadventurertest.out

Development of Adventurer random testing required me to take out the bugs 
introduced in refactor.txt.  The bugs caused segfaults that stopped all testing,
and made development of the random tester impossible.  I will reintroduce
the bugs at the appropriate time.  Coverage from the random tester seems solid.
Rather than use assertions, I have opted for print statements with specific
information to make debugging easier.

Overall coverage from randomly testing Adventurer:
Lines executed:27.50% of 560
Branches executed:35.73% of 417
Taken at least once:18.94% of 417
Calls executed:18.95% of 95



Random testing of Great Hall:
to run: make randomcardtest.out

Development of Great Hall was easier after the development of Adventurer,
as I largely followed the same blueprint.  Again, I have opted for print
statements rather than assertions to make debugging information more specific.

Overall coverage from randomly testing Great Hall:
Lines executed:29.46% of 560
Branches executed:36.69% of 417
Taken at least once:19.90% of 417
Calls executed:23.16% of 95
