Every time inputChar() is called, it creates a variable called num and then calls rand() to pick a random number between 0 and 9.  Depending on the number picked, the function returns either ' ', '[', '(', '{', 'a', 'x', '}', ')', or ']'. inputString() creates a variable called num1.  It then implements a loop which chooses a random number between 0 and 3.  It uses this randomness to fill a character array called s with the letters 'r', 'e', 's' or 't'.  It then puts a '\0' at the end of the array to turn the char array into a C-string and returns this.
In order for the error message to be shown and the program to be exited, two conditions must be met at the same time.  The first condition is that inputChar() must be called 9 times and return characters in this order: [, (, {,  ,  a, x, }, ), and finally ].  The second condition is that inputString must return the c-string "reset\0". If these conditions are met, the program will printf "error " and then exit(200).
