Quiz 2: Development of a Random Tester

By: Robert Hines (hinesro)

To compile: gcc testme.c -o testme
To run: ./testme

The way the function under test works is that it's waiting for certain conditions 
to be met before it will progress further into the function with each iteration. 
For this assignment, there are multiple conditions that must be met before the
goal is reached--the error message at the end of the function. By finishing the
implementation of inputChar(), I made sure this function returns a randomly
selected qualifying character that could potentially satisfy one of the conditions
in testme(). The same is true for inputString(), which provides the string that
can ultimately satisfy the testme function. My implementation of inputString() 
returns the string "reset" or one of 8 scrambled variations of that word. In my
test runs, the program reaches the error message in anywhere between 45 and 178
iterations.
