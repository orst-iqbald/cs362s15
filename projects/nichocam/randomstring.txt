The test only seems to care about a few characters, plus the word reset. In the spirit of random I made a string 5 random characters At first I put in the alphabet plus the special characters, but that was a 1/(33^5) chance of getting reset, which I never saw. So to help it along I added 5 extra characters to the random pool 'r' 'e' 's' 'e' 't'. This made reset occur on iteration 2,236,152 the first test, and 304,228 the second. I'm unsure whether I'm supposed to be leading the test or not, because I'm unsure of the intent of my testing.
