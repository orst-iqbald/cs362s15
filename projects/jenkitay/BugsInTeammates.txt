Bug Number: 2

Title: Smithy card does not update current players hand, deck, or discard pile.
 
Class: "Serious Bug"
 
Date:          May 16, 2015
Reported By:   Taylor Jenkins
Email:         jenkitay@onid.oregonstate.edu
 
Product:       Ryan Peterson's Dominion code.

Is it reproducible: Yes
 
Description
===========
   When playing the smithy card, the current player's handCount does not 
   increase by two cards, as expected, nor does the deckCount decrease by 3, nor
   does the discardCount increase by 1.
 
Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
   Pre-conditions:
    handCount = 5
    deckCount = 4
    discardCount = 4
    playedCardCount = 4
    turn = 1
    
   Function call: cardEffect(smithy, 0, 0, 0, &state, handPos, 0);
 
 
Expected Results
----------------
   Smithy Card: 
   There are 10 smithy cards in every game, each costing 4 coins. 
   When a smithy card is played, three cards are drawn from the player's deck by 
   calling the drawCard() function, and added to the player's hand. The smithy 
   card is then discarded from the hand.
   
   Post-conditions:
    handCount = 7
    deckCount = 1
    discardCount = 5
    playedCardCount = 5
    turn = 1
 
 
Actual Results
--------------
   Post-conditions:
    handCount = 5
    deckCount = 4
    discardCount = 4
    playedCardCount = 5
    turn = 1
 
 
Other Information
-----------------

   FAIL Test 1: handCount did not increase by two
           Expected: 7. Returned: 5
           starting handCount = 5 Player = 1
   FAIL Test 2: deckCount did not decrease by three
           Expected: 1. Returned: 4
           starting handCount = 5 Player = 1
   FAIL Test 3: discardCount count not increased by 1

Bug Number: 3

Title: The handCount changes when playing the adventurer card, and no treasure 
   cards are found.
 
Class: "Serious Bug"
 
Date:          May 16, 2015
Reported By:   Taylor Jenkins
Email:         jenkitay@onid.oregonstate.edu
 
Product:       Ryan Peterson's Dominion code.

Is it reproducible: Yes
 
Description
===========
   When playing the adventurer card, and no treasure cards are found in either 
   the deck or in the discard pile, then the handCount should remain 
   unchanged, but it does not.
 
 
Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
   Test preconditions:
        numPlayers = 4
        whoseTurn = 1
        handCount = 45
        Top deck card = 9
        deckCount = 3
        Top discard card = 18
        discardCount = 5
        playedCardCount = 89
        foundcoinsindeck = 0
        foundcoinsindiscard = 0
        
   adventurerEffect(&state, handPos);
 
 
Expected Results
----------------
   Adventurer Card: 
   There are 10 adventurer cards in every game, each costing 6 coins. 
   Playing the adventurer card allows you to draw cards from your deck until you
   have drawn 2 treasure cards. The two treasure cards are added to your hand, 
   and all non-treasure cards are discarded. If the deck is emptied before two 
   treasure cards are drawn, then the discard pile is shuffled, and it becomes 
   the new deck.
   
   Expected postconditions:
        numPlayers = 4
        whoseTurn = 1
        handCount = 33
        Top deck card = -1
        deckCount = 0
        Top discard card = 9
        discardCount = 20
        playedCardCount = 89
        
        Expected: handCount should have remained 45.
 
 
Actual Results
--------------
   Test postconditions:
        numPlayers = 4
        whoseTurn = 1
        handCount = 33
        Top deck card = -1
        deckCount = 0
        Top discard card = 9
        discardCount = 20
        playedCardCount = 89
        
   FAIL Test 1a: current player handCount did not increase by 0
        Expected: 45. Returned: 33
   FAIL Test 5c: No cards should have been added to hand.
        Expected: 22. Returned: 6
