smithy - This is a kingdom card that can be purchased for 4 treasures.  When played during an action phase the player gets draws three cards off the top of their deck that can be used this turn.  The smithy card uses 1 action.  


adventurer - This is a kingdom card that can be purchased for 6 treasures.  When played during an action phase the player searches through their deck until they find 2 treasure cards regardless of their denomination.  These two cards are played in the players hand, while the other cards that were pulled while searching are discarded.  The adventurer card uses 1 action.


discardCard() - This function checks to make sure the card attempting to be played, can actually be played according to the rules, then calls cardEffect to play the card.  It has access to the current game state, the position of the hand of the card to return, the current player, and the trash flag.  If successful, it returns 0.


updateCoins() - This function returns the count of a specific card in a player's discard deck and hand.  It has access to the game state, the player and a bonus value.  It returns 0 on success, which seems to be contradictory to the description of its function.
