Coverage and Random Testing

Development:
I had not done much for random testing but I based mine off of some of the examples to get the process started. I used the same Smithy unit test but made sure to find a way to make it randomized rather than how it was originally implemented. 

After running my two programs I got results that were very pretty much as I would expect.

In my RandomTestCard I found that all the calls that i expected to get called were ran 80-100 percent of the time. An example of this is that it initilized the game 100 percent of the time but didnt run the buycard function at all.
