(40 points) Use gcov to measure code coverage for all of these tests. 
Report your findings by discussing your tests' coverages (statement, 
branch, boundary, etc.), and describe their implications for the tests 
in a file called coverage1.txt, also checked in to your dominion 
directory. I want you to look at the dominion code coverage and find 
out what parts of your code are not covered so that in future you can 
improve your test suite.
