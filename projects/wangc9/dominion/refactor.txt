CS362 Assignment 2
Chunyu Wang

I refactored the code for the following five cards and introduced five bugs: 

smithy: 
I changed the loop until i <= 3. 
This will result in 4 cards being added rather than 3. 

adventurer: 
I changed the end of the second while loop from z = z - 1; to z = - 1;
This will result in only one card being discarded rather than all that should be. 

remodel: 
I changed if (state->hand[currentPlayer][i] == j) to if (state->hand[currentPlayer][i] = j) 
This will result in every card being removed rather than just the trashed card. 

great hall: 
I changed discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0); to discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 1); 
This will result in the card not being added to the played deck in the discardCard() function call. 

minion: 
I changed if (i != currentPlayer) to be if (i == currentPlayer).
This will result in attacking the current player to discard cards down to four, rather than every other player.
