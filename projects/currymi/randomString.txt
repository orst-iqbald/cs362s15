### Random Testing Quiz 2- randomString.txt 


My first order of buisness was that I created a randomly generated string and
randomly generated character from the list of ASCII characters characters,
however this generated no errors as the string needed to be exactly "reset" to
throw an error and had to be at state 9.

So to get my program at state more likely to equal to 9 and to have the string more likely to reset I created a key for the characters and strings that the program required and had the string be assigned randomly from these keys.

This was finally able to at least generate one random error, but its not very
often.
