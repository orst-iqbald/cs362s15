The following 5 cards have been refactored into their own functions.  
The functions are below cardEffect() in the dominion.c file and are of the form play_[cardname]().

Adventurer
Cutpurse
Remodel
Salvager
Smithy

Bugs were inserted into the following 4 cards:

Adventurer:
	I changed the condition on the second while-loop from "z-1 >= 0" to "z-1 > 0".
	This will cause one of the cards in the "temporary hand" to not be discarded afterward.
	So a card remains in the temporary hand, which is a local variable, thus that card will be lost.
	
Remodel:
	I changed 
	      if ( (getCost(state->hand[currentPlayer][choice1]) + 2) > getCost(choice2) )
	to
	      if ( (getCost(state->hand[currentPlayer][handPos]) + 2) > getCost(choice2) )
	So instead of what was chosen to trash, the cost of the remodel (4) will be compared to 
	the card that is to be gained.
	
Salvager:
	I moved
		//+1 buy
        state->numBuys++;
	inside the "if (choice1)" block.
	So if you do not specify choice1 (a card to trash for coins), you do not get the extra buy.

Smithy:
	I changed the 0 to a 1 for the discardCard() flag.
	This will cause the Smithy card to be trashed (removed from the game) and not merely discarded 
	after it is played.
