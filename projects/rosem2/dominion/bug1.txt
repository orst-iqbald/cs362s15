I found that when player 1 plays a Council Room card, player 0 is not getting the card he is suppose to draw. 
When the player who plays Council Room draws, he draws 1 extra card.
When player 1 plays Adventure, the cards he gains, not both are treasure cards.
When Smithy is played, the player is not drawing enough cards.
When Village is played the actions seem to always be set to 2.
