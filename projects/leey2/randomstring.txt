How my inputChar() and inputString() work:

inputChar()
	This function randomly selects a character from 94 different characters. I didn’t feel the need to guide it any further as the necessary characters needed to change state value from 0 to 9 were generated in a relatively short time. 

inputString()
	As the necessary word ‘reset’ has 5 characters, this is how each character is generated. (all of them use the rand function)

1st character = a letter is generated from all small alphabets. 

2nd character = a letter is generated from small vowels.

3rd character = a letter is generated from all small alphabets as long as it’s not the same letter as the first character.

4th character = a letter is generated from small vowels.

5th character = a letter is generated from all small alphabets as long as it’s not the same letter as the first or the second character.

In general, it takes anywhere from 100,000 to 1.500,000 tries to get the error message.
