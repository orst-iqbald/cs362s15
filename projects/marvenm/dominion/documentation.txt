Smithy Card
	The Smithy card allows the player to draw three additional cards from his deck
	
	In the code, smithy is a case in the switch statement in the cardEffect() function and it calls the mdmsmithycardplay() function, which calls the drawCard() function three times, then calls the discardCard() function to discard the smithy card on the played pile.

Adventurer Card
	The Adventurer card allows the player to reveal cards from his deck until he reveals two treasure cards. The player puts those treasure cards into his hand and discards the other revealed cards.
	
	In the code, adventurer is a case in the switch statement and it calls the mdmadventurercardplay() function. That function then enters a while loop which calls drawCard() until two treasure cards are drawn, shuffling if the draw pile has less than 1 card. If the card drawn is not a treasure card, it is added to an array of temporary cards. Then, once the two treasure cards have been drawn, the function enters another loop to add the cards from the temporary hand array to the discard array.
	
	The mdmadventurercardplay() duplicates some code present in both the drawCard() function and the discardCard() function.
	
discardCard() function
	The discard() function is called when a card which has been played needs to be discarded either to the player's discard pile, or to the trash pile. If the trash flag is 0, the card is added to the playedCards array and the playedCardCount increased by one. If the trash flag is 1, then the card is removed from the player's handCount array
	
updateCoins() function
	The updateCoins() function adds the appropriate amount of coins to the coins variable in the gameState struct based on the treasure cards in the player's hand along with any bonus that is passed as an argument to the function.
