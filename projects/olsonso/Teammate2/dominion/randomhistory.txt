Adventurer

I used the hw3 as a base, they are very similar because of a misunderstanding on my part. I loop 1500 times using a pre and post function style states.  The two are asserted to be equal, as well as, the hand count.
As I attempted to improve upon testing, I realized that I made a mistake with paranoia about incorrectly pushing.  Somehow, I am getting seg faults that I cannot debug.  While running on flip, I get a missing debuginfo.... message but I cannot install since it is on flip.  I attempted to transfer over to a linux virtual box but that went downhill in a hurry.  I guess the bottomline is that while everything compiles in gcc just fine and make all creates all of the necessary files, I messed something up.  I believe that I am close to 90% line and branch coverage with the current test.  I will continue to work at this on my own this week because it is important that I get it right for my own development.

This is based of the adventurer test concept, again two states and they are test to ensure they are equal, handcount, playedcardcount, cardeffect.  I did not use assert here, rather three conditional statements, one per.
This is essentially the same thing as above, I believe that line and branch coverage for this test is approxiamtely 80% based on past testing.  I am unsure if I altered my dominion.c or messed up one of the original functions because it seems good otherwise.  This has proven to be very challenging for me, which is good because it means that I am learning new things.  I am not sure of any other way to design a random tester, I look forward to the project where collaboration is permitted and I am much more comfortable with Java.
