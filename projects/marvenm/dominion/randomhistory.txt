randomtestadventurer.c

I originally experimented with the player being chosen by random, but decided it was more important to have the cards randomly chosen. By choosing the player at random, no bug in mdmadventurercardplay() would be exposed. I was able to get around 25% branch coverage as it is written and I would have been able to get more coverage if I called more game play functions. I called cardEffect() to test the adventurer card function, but if I would have called more functions as if a game were actually being played, more of the branches would have been covered. If I had called more functions that way, I would not have found more bugs in mdmadventurercardplay(), so the extra coverage would not have been beneficial.

randomtestcard.c

I decided to randomize the cards in the decks and the choice of which card will be discarded. I checked the game state prior to playing the salvager card and the post game state afterwards to ensure that the card actions were completed correctly. As with the previous test, I could have gotten more coverage by calling more functions as if a game were being played, but I don't think it would have helped find more errors in the salvager card.
