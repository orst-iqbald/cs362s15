The 5 cards I moved to their own functions are Smithy, Adventurer, Treasure Map,
Steward, and Great Hall.

I introduced bugs in Smithy, Adventurer, Treasure Map, and Steward
Smithy:
I changed the trashFlag value in the call to discardCard() from 0 to 1, which 
means that when the Smithy card gets played it will get trashed instead of
added onto the Played pile. (line 1161)
Adventurer:
I changed the condition for the while loop from "drawntreasure < 2" to "drawntreasure
<= 2" because that would be an easy mistake to make. This will make playing the 
Adventurer card even more advantageous. (line 1172)
Treasure Map:
I changed the if statement looking for another Treasure Map to remove the part
that checked that i != handPos. This means that every time this function is
called it will decide there is another Treasure Map and act accordingly. (line 1202)
Steward:
I changed the "else if (choice1 == 2)" to "if (choice1 == 2)". As a result, the
final else statement will now also be entered when choice1 is 1. (line 1236)
