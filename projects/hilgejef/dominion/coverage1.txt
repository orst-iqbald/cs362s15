Card tests for 1 and 2 can not be executed because bug introductions
in refactor.txt have caused them to produce segfaults.

Unit tests all currently have low branch and line coverage rates, and
could be improved.

Card tests have solid branch and line coverage but also cover less area.

Overall thoughts:  Overall, I think my test cases did a pretty good job
of covering the lines, branches, and calls of the functions that 
they were designed to test.  Still, I think my error messages could be
more clear and the test cases somewhat more robust.  Additionally, I was
unsure if the bugs introduced in refactor.txt on Assignment 2 should
remain, as they prevented test coverage of Smithy and Adventurer. These bugs,
which create segfaults when executing either the playSmithy or playAdventurer
functions, have been denoted in bug1.txt.
