//    method, and updateCoins() method.

Adventurer Card: 
   There are 10 adventurer cards in every game, each costing 6 coins. 
   Playing the adventurer card allows you to draw cards from your deck until you 
   have drawn 2 treasure cards. The two treasure cards are added to your hand, 
   and all non-treasure cards are discarded. If the deck is emptied before two 
   treasure cards are drawn, then the discard pile is shuffled, and it becomes 
   the new deck.

Smithy Card: 
   There are 10 smithy cards in every game, each costing 4 coins. 
   When a smithy card is played, three cards are drawn from the player's deck by 
   calling the drawCard() function, and added to the player's hand. The smithy 
   card is then discarded from the hand.

discardCard() method: 
   If the card has not been flagged to be trashed, it is added to the discard 
   pile. It is then removed from the players hand.
   

updateCoins() method: 
   Iterate through each card in a players hand. If a card is a treasure card, 
   the number of coins is incremented by the value of the treasure card. If a 
   card includes bonus coins, the bonus is added to the number of coins.
