CS 362 Assignment 4

First of all, I decided to run both tests 200 times in order to get more tests done and get a larger pool of tests to look at.

For my adventurer card test, I basically rewrote my old test from scratch. I thinkI overcomplicated it before, so I decided
that it would be better if I just started over to try and simplify everything. 

For my other test, I chose to test the smithy card. I made this test almost identical to the adventurer card test, and I was
happy with its overall simplicity.

Each test had 100% coverage according to gcov, which is very good. My intial testing found a small bug in my custom smithy
function where it didn't add the correct number of cards. Seeing as it was a small error, I decided to fix it instead of letting
it go. I know part of the point of this asignment was to find these errors, but as it was simply changing one number, I couldn't
resist.


To run everything:

make all

randomtestcard
make runrandomtestcard

randomadventurercard
