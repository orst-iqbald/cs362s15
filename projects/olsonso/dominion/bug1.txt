Assignment 3

For this text file I will be taking about each of my test files and any of the bugs I was able to come across and find in the process. 

unittest1.c
This unit test tested the function shuffle() within dominion.c
No bugs found. 

unittest2.c
This unit test tested the isgameOver() function within dominion.c
Found that the game did not properly quit even with there was no more provice games left in the game.

unittest3.c
This unit test tested the function was to test if the correct values were assigned to the right cards within dominion.c
No bugs found.

unittest4.c
This unit test tested the buyCard() function within dominion.c
no bugs found.

cardtes1.c 
This card test was to test the Smithy card function.
I found when I ran this it found that there was no bugs like I would have expected since I originally changed this function

cardtest2.c
This card test was to test the Village card function.
This one as epected I did not find any bugs

cardtest3.c
This card test was on the Great_hall card function.
This test again had no bugs found. This was expected since I did not mess or change anything in this code.

cardtest4.c
This card test was on the adventurer card. 
This test made me find that the value was not getting decreased as it shold have been affected. The card was never getting discarded like it shoud have.
