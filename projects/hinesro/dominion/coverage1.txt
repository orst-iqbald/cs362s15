After running all tests, gcov showed 32.12% statement coverage for the eight 
unit tests out of the entire dominion project. 


## Card test 1 -- Smithy ##
Full statement coverage.


## Card test 2 -- Adventurer ##
Nearly full statement coverage. There is a scenario my test was unable to cover,
where the player's deck is empty. This is highly unlikely in normal gameplay and
was difficult behavior to produce. 


## Card test 3 -- Village ##
Full statement coverage.


## Card test 4 -- Cutpurse ##
Nearly full statement coverage. 


## Unit test 1 -- getCost ##
Full path coverage by checking for out of range card values.


## Unit test 2 -- isGameOver ##
Full path coverage. 


## Unit test 3 -- initializeGame ##
Incomplete statement coverage due to several impossible (or improbable) branch 
outcomes in dominion.c. 


## Unit test 4 -- handCard ##
Complete statement coverage, only 2 statements.
