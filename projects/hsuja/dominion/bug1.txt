Bugs in scoreFor():

	The deck is not properly iterated through because discardCount is used at the limit in the loop as opposed to deckCount. Therefore, if the number of cards in deck and discard are not equal, then the score from victory cards in the deck may not be properly calculated.

	Victory points for the gardens card are not properly calculated. A gardens card should yield one victory point for every 10 cards in the player's deck, hand, and discard. However, the present code adds a victory point for every 10 curse cards in the player's deck, hand, and discard.

Bugs in play_adventurer():

	When the deck becomes empty, the function incorrectly increments drawntreasure. As a result, if the deck starts empty or becomes empty at any time before two treasure cards are drawn, then at most 1 treasure card is drawn, instead of 2.

	play_adventurer() does not even need to check if the deck is empty because it calls drawCard(), which takes care of the empty deck case. play_adventurer(), as it is currently written, attempts to shuffle an empty deck, which effectively does nothing because when shuffle() is passed an empty deck, it simply returns -1.

Bugs in play_smithy():

	play_smithy() fails to discard the played smithy card from the player's hand.

Bugs in play_great_hall():

	play_great_hall() only draws a card when the hand position of the great hall card is greater than 2.
