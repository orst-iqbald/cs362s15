cardtest1 - goes into an infinite loop (one I put in)

cardtest2 - uncovers a discrepancy between actual and expected treasure cards
			obtained (problem I put in)
			
cardtest1, cardtest2, cardtest3, and cardtest4 - appear to show a possible
			problem with discardCard().  And/or in my understanding of it.
			discardCard() doesn't appear to modify struct gameState.discardCount[player].
			I thought it should.
