Assignment 2 - Refactor.txt

Adventurer:
	- I created a new method, adventurerEffect, that contains all of the logic to run the adventurer card. 
	- Prototype: int adventurerEffect(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer)
	- Bugs introduced:
		1. Line 648: drawnTreasure is initialized but should also be set to 0. 
		2. Line 651: z is initialized but should also be set to 0.  

Smithy:
	- I created a new method, smithyEffect, that contains all of the logic to run the smithy card. 
	- Prototype: int smithyEffect(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos)
	- Bugs introduced:
		1. Line 676: the for loop should be i < 3, not i <= 3. 

Village:
	- I created a new method, villageEffect, that contains all of the logic to run the village card. 
	- Prototype: int villageEffect(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos)
	- Bugs introduced:
		1. Line 690: It should be + 2 not * 2. Currently it's doubling the number of actions, not adding 2. 

Great Hall:
	- I created a new method, greatHallEffect, that contains all of the logic to run the great hall card. 
	- Prototype: int greatHallEffect(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos)
	- Bugs introduced: 
		1. Line 701: Should be numActions++ not --. Currently it's removing an action instead of adding one. 

Outpost:
	- I created a new method, outpostEffect, that contains all of the logic to run the outpost card. 
	- Prototype: int outpostEffect(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos)
	- Bugs introduced:
		1. The function is completely missing the fact that the outpost card is actually played (state->outpostPlayed++;). Instead it just discards the card and moves on.
