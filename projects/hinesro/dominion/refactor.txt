This document outlines the changes I've made to 5 action cards that I've refactored.

1. adventurer

Added bug where treasure is drawn until drawnTreasure is <= 2, instead of just < 2.
This should loop an extra time and yield 3 treasure cards for the player instead of
just 2. Also added bug where the temporary hand is not fully discarded, which should
result in the player ending up with an extra non-treasure card in their hand in most
situations.


2. council_room

Refactored the code into its own function without the intentional addition of any
new bugs. This should behave as expected. 


3. feast

Introduced subtle bug where a 5-cost card (or less) can be drawn when there is a 
negative supply of that card on the board. If supply is 0 or more, the action 
should still behave as expected.


4. mine

Added possibly severe bug where cards matching the player's choice will continuously
be discarded if occuring in their hand in successive order.


5. smithy

Added bug where the card is not discarded at the end of the turn, which should 
result in a persistant smithy card any time the player calls this action.
