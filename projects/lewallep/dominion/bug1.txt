// All tests passed properly.  No bugs found.


// cardtest1.c
// card tested: smithy
// Test Failed.  
// It is my understanding there is only one test which can be administered.  In differeent forms.  I check to see
// if the current hand of the user when the card is played is incremented by two cards.  This is because the Smith card is played
// so that is -1 to the handCount.  Then three cards are picked up.  -1 + 3 == 2. I then test this relationship on decks with
// different size hands and different players.
//
// The test failed in that too many cards are drawn by the function.  This is the bug I introduced in the previous assignment.

// cardtest2.c
// card tested: adventurer
// 
// Bugs:
// The only cards which card drawn are returning are copper.  This will need to be tested later starting
// with the initialization function.
// 
// When the z counter for the temp hand variable is changed for the function test it shows the test fails.
// This corresponds with the bug I introduced in the second assignment.

// cardtest3.c
// card tested: gardens
//
// Bugs:
// None.  The function works as specified.  Of note, there is only one  function and that is to return -1.
// No arguments are passed to the function therefore we have a very discrete domain of numbers.

// cardtest4.c
// card tested: village
// 
// Bugs:
// No bugs were detected.  The bug I attemped to put in had no effect on the playability as the handpos
// did not change hence, the discard order within the function which I changed, had no effect.
// At least it did not have any effect as far as my tests were able to detect at this point.
