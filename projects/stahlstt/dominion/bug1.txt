Assignment 3

check council room
Assertion failed: (pre.handCount[pre.whoseTurn] == post->handCount[pre.whoseTurn]), 
	function testCouncil_Room, file cardtest3.c, line 57.
expected, as the player drew a card rather than the other players. 

check adventurer
/bin/sh: line 1: 86511 Segmentation fault: 11 
from the refactored Adventurer code (commenting out the line that call that 
cardEffect allows the code to run normally). 
expected, as the player is drawing an extra card. the ultimate failure was less 
expected, and I was sure the dominion.c code worked last week. 

check smithy
Assertion failed: (pre.handCount[pre.whoseTurn] == post->handCount[pre.whoseTurn]), 
	function checkSmithy, file cardtest1.c, line 46.
expected, as the player drew one less card than needed. 

check great_hall
no errors found. since I haven't introduced any, that's probably good.
