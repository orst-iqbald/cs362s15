discardCard():
	Determine which pile to discard the card to via a flag named "trashFlag"
	If not trashed
		Get the card in the specified position (handPos) and add it to playedCards
		Increment playedCardCount
	update the gamestate to show the player no longer has the card in their hand
	If the card is the last card in the players hand, just shrink the hand by 1 (lazymode!)
	If the card is the only card in the hand, shrink the hand by 1
		(I'm pretty sure this is actually dead code because it would also be the last card in the hand)
	Else:
		Shift all the cards and remove the card from the hand

updateCoins():
	Confirm that coins start at 0
	For each card in the players hand, determine if it is a coin card
		If it is copper
			increment state->coins by 1
		If it is silver
			increment state->coins by 2
		If it is gold
			increment state->coins by 3
	Increment state->coins by the bonus value from previously played cards that turn.
