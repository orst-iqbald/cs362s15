The unit tests for the four non-card functions passed without issue. These tests cover about 25% of dominion.c. This means that only a quarter or so of the code is actually being run in the tests. This does not, however, say anything about how much of the code's functionality is being tested. It's likely that far less functionality is being tested than code is being run when the tests run. The two are exclusive.

To improve coverage we can write a lot more tests that hit each part of the code, but the important thing to keep in mind is to actually write tests that matter, because coverage only tells you whether the code is being run, not whether it is correct.

Unfortunately, unit tests failed in the card tests, so gcov was unable to report coverage because the tests did not complete. There are two reasons the unit tests failed:

1. We were told to introduce bugs into our own code.
2. There were pre-existing bugs in the code.

Because we are not yet allowed to fix these bugs, the unit tests cannot cover the card functions in which these bugs exist.
