I created an variable int returnValue in the function cardEffect the variable does not introduce any bugs, it just holds the return value 
of the function call of the newly created function.  In most cases the function returns 0, but it is possible in the remodel function call 
to return -1, thus the reason for creating the returnValue variable.

In the function smithyCard() I refactored the code to have a small bug.  The bug was in the fouth parameter of the discardCard function call.  
I changed the value of the trashFlag from 0 to 1.  Thus, the player will play the smithy card once then it will be trashed instead of being put 
back into the playerâ€™s hand.

In the function adventurerCard() I changed the less than sign in the first if statement of the first while loop to a less than or equal sign.  
Thus the deck will be reshuffled not on empty but with one card remaining.  

In the stewardCard() I changed the else if statement is equal to sign to less than or equal to.  Thus, the user will get 2 coins on a draw 2 
card choice not just on a +2 coin choice.
 
In the remodelCard function I changed the argument in the getCost function call from +2 to +3.  The change means the user will be able to select 
a card of value 3 more than the trashed card, not 2 more which is supposed to be the case.
 
There is a function mineCard() that I created.  There are zero bugs in this function.
