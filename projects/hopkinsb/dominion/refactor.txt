I chose to refactor the adventurer, smithy, steward, cutpurse, and salvager cards.
The functions for these cards were created and placed above the cardEffect function
in the dominion.c file and are called in the respective cases in the cardEffect function.

Below are the bugs that I introduced into each of these 5 cards.

Adventurer card: 
    The if statement that checks to see if treasure has been drawn no longer counts gold
	treasure cards as drawn treasure. The code was changed as shown below:
		FROM:   if (cardDrawn == copper || cardDrawn == silver || cardDrawn == gold)
	            drawntreasure++;
		 
		 TO:   if (cardDrawn == copper || cardDrawn == silver)
	           drawntreasure++;
			   
Smithy card: 
	The for loop that calls the drawCard function now runs 5 times instead of 3. The
	code was changed as shown below: 
	    FROM:   for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
				{
					drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
				}
				
		TO:     for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
				{
					drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
				}
				
Steward card: 
	The if statement that checks if choice1 is equivalent to 1 was changed so that 
	choice1 must be less than 1 for the statement to be ran. The code was changed 
	as shown below: 
		FROM:   if (choice1 == 1)
				{
					//+2 cards
					drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
					drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
				}
				
		TO:     if (choice1 < 1)
				{
					//+2 cards
					drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
					drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
				}

Cutpurse card: 
	The if statement that checked to see if the card in the hand was a copper was
	changed to look for a gold treasure card instead. The code was changed as 
	shown below: 
		FROM:   if (state->hand[i][j] == copper)
				{
					discardCard(j, i, state, 0);
					break;
				}
		
		TO:     if (state->hand[i][j] == gold)
				{
					discardCard(j, i, state, 0);
					break;
				}
				
Salvager card: 
	The if statement that adds coins to the player's total was changed so that
	it instead subtracts coins from the user's total. The code was changed 
	as shown below: 
		FROM:   if (choice1)
				{
					//gain coins equal to trashed card
					state->coins = state->coins + getCost( handCard(choice1, state) );
					//trash card
					discardCard(choice1, currentPlayer, state, 1);	
				}
				
		TO:     if (choice1)
				{
					//gain coins equal to trashed card
					state->coins = state->coins - getCost( handCard(choice1, state) );
					//trash card
					discardCard(choice1, currentPlayer, state, 1);	
				}
