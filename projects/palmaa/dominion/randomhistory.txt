The amount of coverage from the unit tests and the card tests from
Assignment 3 was as follows:
	File 'dominion.c'
	Lines executed:22.19% of 649
	Branches executed:23.26% of 417
	Taken at least once:17.75% of 417
	No calls
	
	
The amount of coverage given by the test, randomtestcard (alone), was:
	File 'dominion.c'
	Lines executed:20.03% of 649
	Branches executed:23.26% of 417
	Taken at least once:14.39% of 417
	No calls

While the amount of coverage afforded by randomtestadventurer (alone) was:
	File 'dominion.c'
	Lines executed:20.34% of 649
	Branches executed:24.70% of 417
	Taken at least once:15.83% of 417
	No calls
	
On a superficial level it doesn't look like much change.  Especially since
they are essentially testing the same target code.  Or at least the unit or
method to be run.

When we look at the amount of coverage given after running all these tests, it
looks to be a bit better:
	File 'dominion.c'
	Lines executed:34.21% of 649
	Branches executed:36.21% of 417
	Taken at least once:28.78% of 417
	No calls


I would think that there were more edge cases being covered with the increased
amount and type of input.

For randomizing the input, I only just initialized the game a number of times
(small number, about 5000).  I let the shuffle and randomization mechanics of the
game take care of the random bits?  I just fed in a random seed with each run.  A
better method probably would've been to some vary the input more (maybe making my
own shuffle routine).

I'm seeing some weird behavior.  Maybe I noticed it before?  Something seems off with
the discard card functionality.  And/or maybe I just don't understand what it's supposed
to be doing.
