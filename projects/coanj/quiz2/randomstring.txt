Quiz 2: Random Testing

After learning how the code functioned, I decided to ensure I was able to cause the error to occur in
one go. So I created the ideal situation to test the code. I created an array with the characters that
would be used to set the state and walked through them individually. I set the string directly to "reset\0".
This would ensure I understood exactly what was to be expected and would give me some sort of start.

After running the code, and watching the behavior, I then decided to create the inputChar function that
would return a char randomly selected from the group of characters that would be used in testing the state.
This would greatly reduce the amount of time needed for the test since all other characters are invalid
anyway.

I then began to work on the inputString function, which again I decided the characters that made up the
string "reset\0" would be sufficient for testing. So I created a 6 char string array, looped through
that array 6 times assigning a char randomly grabbed from the string "reset\0". This would build a string
to be returned that was randomly constructed only from those characters and since all other characters
are pointless in causing the error here, there was no reason to include any characters outside that set.
In essence, this returns a randomly generated string from 6 randomly selected characters. Eventually after
enough iterations the word "reset\0" would be returned and set the error message successfully.
