Using gcov dominion.c -f after successful running of test funcitons i was able to analyze the coverage of the functions being tested.  

Unittest1.txt running a randomized test on update coins I was Able to achieve 100% coverage on lines, branches and statements.  I used a randomized test, to generate great coverage.

Unittest2.txt is the test of the shuffle function I was able to achieve 15 out of 16 lines with 93.75% test coverage of the function.  I executed all 8 branches and took 7 out of 8 at least once.

Unittest3.txt I ran the endTurn function I was able to execute 95.00% of lines. With 19/20 lines executed.  I had 100% branch coverage with 6/6 and I was able to execute 100% of calls and took boundary 5/6 times for 83.33% coverage.

Unittest4.txt I tested discardCard function I executed 92.31% of the lines with 12/13 of the lines being covered.  There were no calls to other functions made as, and I executed 6/6 branches and took them at least once 83.33 % of the time.

Cardtest1.txt was the test of the smithyCard function I executed all 5 lines 2/2 branches at least once 100% of the time and executed 2 out of 2 calls.  The smithCard function had total and absolute coverage.

Cardtest2.txt was the test of the adventurerCard function I executed 16/17 lines for 94.12% coverage and executed all 12 branches and took 9/12 branches at least once and only executed 1 out of 2 calls for 50% call coverage.  Missing one out of 2 of the calls is not good coverage.

Cardtest3.txt was the test of the stewardCard function I executed all 10 lines, all the branches and took 4/4 branches at least once 100% of the time, and executed 5/5 calls.  The stewardCard function had total and absolute coverage.

Cardtest4.txt was the test of the remodelCard function, I had to comment out my assertions to get this one to past the randomized test on a regular basis.  I got 10/11 lines executed for 90.91% line execution. I executed all 6 branches and took them 5/6 times for 83.33% coverage.  I executed 5/5 calls for 100% execution.

Overall I would say I got pretty good coverage.  I need better work on getting both legs of the branch function and I need to make sure I make all the calls within a funciton.
