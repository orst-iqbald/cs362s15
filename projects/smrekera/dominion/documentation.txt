Assignment 2

Adventure:
	This switch statement starts by checking if two treasure cards are displayed. The statement will check to see if the deck is empty and if it is then it will shuffle the deck. It will then draw a card by choosing the top card on the deck. If the card is a copper, silver or gold card it will add the amount to the drawn treasure respectfully. If the card is not a treasure card it will be put in a temphand and move to the next card in the deck. While the cards are drawn, they are displayed until 2 treasure cards are displayed.

Smithy:
	This switch statement uses a for loop to draw the first 3 cards from the top of the deck by using the drawCard function.

discardCard():
	This method checks if a card is added back to the player's card pile. If it is, then it adds it back to the player's card pile and subtracts the card from the player's hand. It checks if the last card in the hand is played and if it is, it subtracts the card count. If not, it checks if it is the only card in the player's hand and if so it subtracts it from the hand count. If the two before are not true, it will replace the discarded card with the last card int the hand, set last card to -1 and reduce the card count in the player's hand.

updateCoins()
	This method sets coin count to 0. It then loops through the player's hand to check if the cards are copper, silver or gold. If they are, 1, 2 or 3 is added to the player's coin count respectfully. The coin count is then added to the bonus count.
