unittest1.c
This file tests updateCoins():
	There seems to be a bug in the way the function counts coins in the hand. 
	It is possible the 2-d array state.hand[player][i] is not correctly implemented or 
	possibly the for-loop isn't reaching to the end of the hand.
	
unittest2.c
This file tests getCost():
	The tests I ran didn't discover any bugs.
	Tests were ran to check if the cardNumber matched the card, if the correct cost was returned, and if the function
	detected bad input cardnumbers.

unittest3.c
This file tests fullDeckCount()
	There is a bug when placing random cards in the deck and retrieving the specific amount for a particular card. 


unittest4.c
This file tests isGameOver()
	The function isGameOver() breaks when called a large number of times.
