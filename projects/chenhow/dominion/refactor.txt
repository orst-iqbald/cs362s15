These are the five cards that were refactored.

ADVENTURER: cardAdventurer(currentPlayer, state)
    - The adventurer card was implemented in its own function called cardAdventurer.
      It has the parameters currentPlayer and state.
    - LINE 1174 (BUG): In the while loop the condition (drawntreasure < 2) was changed to
        (drawntreasure < 4). This will cause the effect of the card to draw 4 treasure cards
        instead of 2.
        
SMITHY: cardSmithy(handPos, currentPlayer, state)
    - The smithy card was implemented in its own function called cardSmithy. It has the 
      parameters handPos, currentPlayer, and state.
    - LINE 1200 (BUG): In the for loop to draw three cards (i < 3), the limit of 'i' is
      changed to (i < 2). This will cause the effect of the smithy card to draw only 2 cards
      instead of 3. 
    - LINE 1207 (BUG): discardCard is commented out causing the smithy card to remain in
      current player's hand.
      
 MINE: cardMine(handPos, choice1, choice2, currentPlayer, state)
    - The mine card was implemented in its own function called cardMine. It has the parameters
      handPos, choice1, choice2, currentPlayer, and state.
    - LINE 1240-1247 (BUG): This section of code originally intended to trash the treasure card 
      chosen by player, but it is commented out so that the card never gets trashed. 
      
VILLAGE: cardVillage(handPos, currentPlayer, state)
    - The village card was implemented in its own function called cardVillage. It has the 
      parameters handPos, currentPlayer, and state.
    - LINE 1256-1259 (BUG): A loop was added to the drawCard effect of the village card. Instead
      of only drawing 1 card, the loop will draw 3 cards from the deck.
    - LINE 1263 (BUG): The numbers of actions added was changed from 2 to 4. 
    
GREAT HALL: cardGreatHall(handPos, currentPlayer, state)
    - The great hall card was implemented in its own function called cardGreatHall. It has the 
      parameters handPos, currentPlayer, and state.
    - LINE 1274 (BUG): The code was changed from drawing a single card to no card drawn.
    - LINE 1278 (BUG): The code was changed so that the player gets 3 actions instead of 1.
