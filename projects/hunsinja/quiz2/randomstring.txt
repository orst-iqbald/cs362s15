inputChar() returns a random character from the set ('[', '(', '{', ' ', 'a', 'x', '}', ')', ']').

inputString() returns a string consisting of a subset of the set of characters ('r', 'e', 's', 't', '\0').

The testme() function after initialization and entering an endless while loop calls inputChar() and inputString().
These values are evaluated against a series of if statements. The first nine involve checking the character returned
by inputChar(), and only advancing a state by one if the character is at the index of the given set of the current
state (ie if the state is 2, the state will only increment to 3 if the returned character is '{'). After the state
has reached 9, it is possible for the final if statement to resolve. This waits until the returned string equals
'reset\0'. At this point, it prints out an error message and exits with the code 200.
