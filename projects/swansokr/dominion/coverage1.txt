--Analysis of Coverage--
Here is the coverage for all my tests:

Lines executed:29.81% of 577
Branches executed:34.29% of 417
Taken at least once:27.34% of 417
Calls executed:16.84% of 95

So that is not very good coverage: everything is below 50%.
The trouble is, I am not testing all the functions in dominion.c, so of course I am not getting much coverage.
So I do not see that this information is much use until we have tests for all the functions. 
Below is the test-by-test coverage.  Some functions call each other, so that is why the % total coverage does not equal their sum.

--Analysis of Corner Cases--

For all tests:
	1. I have not been testing with various players (my currentPlayer is always 1, with 2 players total).

For unittest1 (discardCard());
	(I can't think of anything significant that I missed).

For unittest2 (scoreFor()):
	1. Did not try different victory cards in the same area (deck/hand/discard) at the same time.
	2. Did not include any non-scored cards.

For unittest3 (endTurn()):
	1. Did not do any checking concerning outpostPlayed.
	2. Did not check that the correct cards were discarded, but merely that the discard pile had the correct number of cards.
	3. Did not check that the correct cards were drawn, but merely that the correct number were.
	
For unittest4 (updateCoins()):
	1. Never tested a hand that had silver or gold but no coppers.
	2. Never tested a hand with more than 1 silver or gold.
		
For cardtest1 (Smithy):
	1. Did not check that the Smithy card (its handPos) was the card that was discarded
	2. Did not check that the correct cards were added to the hand, but merely the correct number.

For cardtest2 (Adventurer):
	1. Did not check to make sure the Adventurer card (its handPos) was the card that was to be played.
	2. Did not check that the cards added to the hand were in fact the first treasure cards to be found.
	
For cardtest3 (Cutpurse):
	1. Did not check that the Cutpurse card (its handPos) was the card that was played from the player's hand.
	2. Never had any treasure cards in the player's hand (or other pre-existing coin bonuses).
	3. Did not try having more than 2 players (so only one player was being attacked).

For cardtest4 (Sea Hag):
	1. Did not check that the Sea Hag card (its handPos) was the card that was played from the player's hand.
	2. Did not check that specific card that the other player discarded was the one that was on top of their deck.
	3. Did not try having more than 2 players (so only one player was being attacked).
